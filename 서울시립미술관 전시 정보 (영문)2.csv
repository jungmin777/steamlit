1395217,558,A World of Paintings: On the Lee Kun-hee Collection,,Buk-Seoul Museum of Art,2025-04-30,2025-07-20,,,"Seoul Museum of Art, Sponsored by Dunn-Edwards Paints",,,"Painting, Print",60,"Kang Yobae, Quac Insik, Kwon Okyon, Kim Bongtae, Bang Haija, Yoo Youngkuk, Lee Insung, Ha Indoo",,"<p><em>A World of Paintings: On the Lee Kun-hee Collection</em> focuses on painting, the medium with the longest history in fine art, by tracing the journey of eight artists from the Lee Kun-hee Collection who sought what only paintings could express amid the tumultuous modern and contemporary history of Korea. This exhibition takes as its starting point 36 works from the Lee Kun-hee Collection, donated to the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea (MMCA) and regional museums in 2021, as well as pieces from the collection of the Leeum Museum of Art. It also incorporates 24 additional works from the Seoul Museum of Art, other public and private museums, galleries, and private collections, allowing for a deeper understanding of each artist’s body of work.</p><p><br></p><p>Painting, as a form of fine art, is a two-dimensional practice based on the act of depicting shapes and layering colors. In contemporary art, where different disciplines intermingle and media continuously expand, traditional painting might seem like a thing of the past. And yet that is the unique characteristic that makes painting what it is and the very source of its vitality, allowing it to breathe and come alive. For the eight artists&nbsp;included in this exhibition, all of whom were born between 1912 and 1952,&nbsp;art has always been synonymous with painting for them. This exhibition explores three main themes based on distinctive qualities of painting: “Appearance, Scenes, and Nature,” “Color Is Alive,” and “The Act of Spiritual Practice through Materials.”</p><p><br></p><p>The title of the exhibition, <em>A World of Paintings</em>, is borrowed from Lee Insung, a key figure in Korea's modern art scene, who metaphorically described painting as “a special world that represents the aesthetic consciousness of the artist.” It implies the intention to explore the ultimate world that artists sought to reach through painting. Further to that, and inspired by participating artist Kang Yobae’s belief that the term “painting” is insufficient to express the profound meaning of painting?encompassing both the act of <em>drawing and coloring</em> and the sentiment of “longing” in the Korean language?this exhibition delves into the eight artists’ hearts and aspirations, which are deeply embedded in their works and lives.</p><p><br></p><p>These eight artists lived through an incredibly difficult period of Korean history, from the Japanese colonial period &nbsp;to the Korean War and national division, followed by post-war turmoil. Being a painter during these years was never easy. In times when it was difficult to even imagine a bright future, the act of painting stemmed from the desperation brought on by each individual’s circumstances. For them, painting was both the very essence of unrestrained freedom and a path in pursuit of beauty. It was also a dream and a utopia that they strived to reach while delving into their inner selves.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Although these artists accepted Western modern and contemporary art directly or indirectly as a stylistic tool, they continuously sought ways to express their own identities and narratives, ultimately constructing unique bodies of work. We hope this exhibition offers an opportunity to experience the vast horizons of painting through these individuals’ artworks, all of which, taken together, encompass the three themes of the exhibition. Additionally, we hope it allows for a rediscovery of their artistic language and messages, which remain extremely relevant today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Landscape&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Appearance, Scenes, and Nature</strong></p><p>The first theme, “Landscape,” comprises figures, still lifes, and nature. From natural scenery and all the surrounding people and objects to unknown places that seem to appear in dreams, the artists visualize landscapes that captivate their gaze or hold a special place in their hearts. Among these works, nature?an enduring theme in landscape art?emerges as a crucial subject matter that reflects the inner world of the artists. Nature and landscapes are sometimes depicted as scenes imbued with national sentiment and, at other times, as surreal visions from the imagination, taking on myriad interpretations.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Color</strong></p><p><strong>Color Is Alive and Moving</strong></p><p>The second theme explores the potential of color beyond imagery. The artists who prioritized color as a fundamental element of composition commonly present abstract works based on color fields in geometric forms. The simple and concise arrangement of lines and planes in their paintings serves to highlight color on their canvas. Within their works, color pulsates with life, moving toward the archetype of pure nature and a primal world brimming with vitality.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Materiality</strong></p><p><strong>The Act of Spiritual Practice through Materials</strong></p><p>The final theme of this exhibition explores materiality, which emerges in depth on a two-dimensional plane through the artist’s repetitive actions. Emptying their minds and focusing their spirits through their breath, these artists’ process of confronting materials closely resembles the actions of a spiritual practitioner in pursuit of the essence of existence. A common trait among this type of artist is the continuous layering of color not only on the front but also on the reverse side of the paper. Colors that overlap, seep into one another, and gain movement are transformed?through their encounter with the materiality of paper?into a luminous space beyond the surface.&nbsp;</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2025%2F&FILE_NM=20250410135127_bae0ea39211f4fc7a87b133dbcc72428_be98d0a205c748c183d75ac18cf5842a,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1395217,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
1393208,559,Take My Eyes Off,,Buk-Seoul Museum of Art,2025-04-30,2025-07-20,,,Supported by Samhwa Paint,,,Painting,62,"MeeNa Park, Rahm Parc, Miryu Yoon, Yeongbin Yoon, Eunsae Lee, Yebin Chang, Hyerim Jun, Suejin Chung",,"<p><em>Take My Eyes Off</em> is an exhibition that examines painting?entangled in a turbulent affair with ‘vision’ and ‘image’?and highlights the strategies of contemporary painting. The exhibition presents contemporary painting that responds to today’s image-saturated visual environment and seeks a new ‘visuality,’ using the motif of the ‘eye’ to reveal painting’s potential as a site of practice. Framed by the Seoul Museum of Art’s 2025 agenda of ‘Action’ and featured as part of Buk-Seoul Museum of Art’s special theme, ‘Countermoves of Painting,’ <em>Take My Eyes Off</em> seeks to reexamine contemporary painting and invite social and cultural reflection through painting.</p><p><br></p><p>Painting is a visual art form that uses color and line to create shapes on a two-dimensional surface such as canvas or paper. Bound by its flat, motionless surface and the expectation that it presents an image that is either beautiful or pleasing to look at, painting was long regarded as a static form?an art without a future. Yet, as art historian David Joselit has declared, painting remains a “live medium,” one that is constantly entangled with reality and unfolding “on the air.” Contemporary painting actively engages with the logic of images as they circulate and are consumed in the digital age, renewing itself in the process. In doing so, it reveals how images affect and collide with our vision. It moves and awakens the eyes bound to the image, urging us to imagine a path forward?not a closed ending. Painting is no longer a flat image hanging on a wall, nor merely something pleasing to the eye?it is a simultaneous stage that constantly throws our vision into motion.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Take My Eyes Off</em> presents the story of painting pushing against its own limits?focusing on contemporary works that shake our vision loose from the images it clings to. Eight painters explore perceptual and cognitive shifts, working at the intersection of image and vision. Their works give form to the strategies of contemporary painting and point toward a narrative that remains “on the air.” Structured in four parts, the exhibition unfolds like a film or drama. And it begins with this: our eyes tremble. And then?they take off. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2025%2F&FILE_NM=20250411102407_d95afcb6b9a245849b200c4eb23cd14d_2bc8b8b2e6c04e109a638b1c19c21e38,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1393208,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The GanaArt Collection consists of 200 artworks donated by Lee Ho-jae, the Chairman of GanaArt, in 2001. The donation consists of <em>Minjung Art</em> and realist art that passionately portray aspects of 1980s and 1990s Korean society.</p><p><br>With 80 years having passed since Korea’s liberation, the generation that experienced Japanese colonial rule, liberation, the Korean War , and national division firsthand has given way to the next generation &nbsp; that did not. The 95 percent of today’s Korean population born post-liberation has only learned about the series of monumental events that took place before and after liberation as historical facts through extant records. Through the works in the GanaArt Collection, this exhibition seeks to allow viewers to empathize more deeply with past circumstances by providing social, political, and historical contexts and introducing personal narratives that have remained on the periphery of the grand discourse of Korean modern and contemporary history.</p><p><br>The exhibition is composed of four parts. Part 1 thematizes Japanese colonial rule and the independence movement, examining the history of pain and sacrifice. Part 2 deals with the horrors of the Korean War as a tragic fratricide. Part 3 reflects on the detriments of national division and social and political issues in postwar Korea. Part 4 explores the future possibilities through works that envision peaceful coexistence beyond war and conflicts.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Artworks in this exhibition are presented alongside poems capturing the 1940s and 1950s spirit of resistance and recovery to vividly convey the resonance of the times. Faithfully harboring the yearning for liberation, the harrowing shadow of war that comes from death, and the pain of national division and ideological conflict, the poems offer an indirect experience of how Korean people persevered through the dark times.</p><p><br>The February 8 Declaration of Independence written by Korean students in Tokyo in 1919 reads, “The Korean people have maintained a sophisticated culture and the experience of a national life for almost 5,000 years. At the same time, the harms and unhappiness resulting from many years of autocracy have led Korean people to today’s reality. Yet &nbsp;we trust the Korean people, who have loved and favored justice and peace since its establishment, will be able to contribute to peace in the world and its culture of humanity, once we can found a new country, modelled after advanced nations and on the foundation of democracy based on justice and freedom.”</p><p><br>The freedom, Koreans take for granted today, is indebted to the sacrifices of our previous generation. The liberty they achieved through their dedication and courage is a precious legacy that we must pass on to future generations. This exhibition commemorating the 80th anniversary of national liberation will hopefully serve as an opportunity to reflect on the value of freedom and a prelude that hold a future of peace and reconciliation.</p><p><br></p><p>※ This exhibition presents 14 works from the Seoul Museum of Art collection and 7 works from the GanaArt Collection.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2025%2F&FILE_NM=20250310160203_4be7ca51d3694e6790b515941714e6ad_c418ea67a22b43f7988394c451b66c63,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1378425,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
1376277,556,Into Other Rivers,,Art Archives,2025-03-06,2025-07-27,,,,,,,,,,"<p dir='ltr'>In the wake of the 2000s, both the field of archival studies and the contemporary art scene in Korea have witnessed a growing discourse around archives. Alongside truth-finding movements addressing the sacrifices and human rights violations embedded in Korea’s modern history, the value of manuscripts?records that remained outside official documentation?has been newly recognized. Simultaneously, critiques of institutional archives, which have long reinforced official histories and dominant narratives, have fueled alternative archival practices. Contemporary art has also engaged with archival theory, generating and reorganizing records to highlight events and subjects omitted from mainstream discourse. Over the past two decades, manuscript collections and archive-based artistic practices have played a key role in recovering marginalized histories and shaping a shared terrain of collective memory.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>This exhibition aligns with the Seoul Museum of Art’s 2025 institutional theme, “action,” explores the social value and activist potential of archival practices today. Revisiting the trajectory of so-called archival art alongside manuscript practices it considers how these two currents contribute to counter-memory and shape evolving critical discourse on archives. In an era of digital saturation, where the rapid production of information coexists with misinformation and so-called alternative facts, the unfolding global crises urge us to reconsider?how we record and interpret the present. This exhibition seeks to reflect on the social role of contemporary art and archives in expanding social memory and amplifying diverse voices.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>The exhibition title<em> Into Other Rivers</em>&nbsp;draws inspiration from the famous saying by the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus (BCE 535&ndash;475), ‘one never steps into the same river twice.’ It underscores the point that records are not permanent?rather, they represent a process of interacting with today’s awareness as we read and perceive them. The exhibition consists of three sections, based on a detailed approach to incidents and objects and their multi-dimensional relationships. “Deferred Memory” presents artwork that turns a contemporary perspective on Korea’s modern and contemporary history and the suppressed community histories within. In connection with this, it displays archival materials associated with the Korea Democracy Foundation and the Korea Queer Archive Queerarch. “Witnessed Record” presents archival materials from the Jeju 4?3 Peace Foundation and the Art Archives, Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA AA) which concern the history of the Jeju 4?3 and the Japanese military “comfort women.” The section also features artwork that creates a space of affect based on meticulous documentation of these histories. “Projected Narrative” presents work that is rooted in real-world issues and archives while constructing new narratives in those spaces of absence. In the process, it liberates realms that have hitherto been obscured by prevailing social ideas, boundaries, and fragmented discourse.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><em>Into Other Rivers</em> highlights how records of the past and present are continuously reshaped and reinterpreted, prompting a renewed awareness of memory, emotion, and perception while exploring the multifaceted nature of archival activism in driving future action.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2025%2F&FILE_NM=20250214193302_e3928ad0706e4a54b5caec98c56032fd_f6f596963a074141a2e080764a923aad,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1376277,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
1371885,555,Myonghi Kang - Visit,,Seosomun Main Branch,2025-03-04,2025-06-08,,,,,,Painting,125,Myonghi Kang,,"<p><em>Myonghi Kang - Visit</em> encompasses the major works in the six-decade artistic career of Myonghi Kang (b. 1947). She has established a unique realm of painting by exploring the essence of natural landscapes and capturing the relationship between existence and nature on canvas through long-term observation. Leaving Korea in 1972 to work around the world, Kang has created paintings that embody the influences of diverse cultures and the interplay of color and sensitivity between East and West. The title <em>Visit</em>, borrowed from one of her works, reflects her nomadic lifestyle of never fully settling in one place and the artistic inspiration from her transient encounters. Her works may appear to be abstractions filled with brilliant light and colors, but, in fact, they originate from a very specific natural element, serving as a concentrated output of contemplation through tenacious discipline and the repetitive act of “emptying out.”<br><br>Kang has persistently explored the essence of nature, traveling from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia and Patagonia in South America to Antarctica, India, Hong Kong, mainland China, and Taiwan in pursuit of pristine landscapes. The brushstrokes and fragments layered on the flat canvas sway and collide like the movements of nature. The seemingly calm and peaceful images are the result of an intimate dialogue with the world or nature, established with countless brushstrokes applied over a long period of time. In this era in which nature itself is endangered, Kang’s paintings, completed through a process of relentless discipline and purification, draw viewers in by encapsulating the history and memory of the earth, destruction and death, and creation and extinction. Experiencing these large-scale images, they encounter nature reinterpreted by the artist as if they are wandering in a boundless world.<br><br>Since returning to her homeland in 2007, Kang has resided in Jejudo and continued to create abstract paintings that capture the vibrant natural landscapes there. Entering a phase of artistic maturity, her art reflects a profound contemplation of nature and humanity. In contrast with contemporary civilization and cutting-edge technology, her artworks exude a powerful energy of life and rebirth, comforting contemporary wounds and pains through the power of art. <em>Myonghi Kang - Visit</em> consists of three sections based on the artist’s spatio-temporal experiences and stream of consciousness rather than on the chronology of her career. The section titles are taken from the artist’s work: “1. Living in Seogwangdong-ri” presents her latest works centered on Jejudo, “2. Visit” highlights her work in France and travels around the world, and “3. Secret Garden” features early works that feed into her current works and provide clues for interpreting her oeuvre.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. Living in Seogwangdong-ri</strong><br>“Living in Seogwangdong-ri” presents relatively recent pieces created since Kang began living in Jejudo in 2007, including paintings connected to her daily life. She works at multiple studios on the island according to her circumstances and needs and has maintained a studio in Seogwangdong-ri for about ten years. While residing in Jejudo, she has continued to spend time creating art abroad, and this section of the exhibition provides an overview of her 18 years of life and art since making Korea her home again. Along with the indoor and outdoor landscapes observed from the studio and still lifes, the paintings on display feature locations in Jejudo such as Hallasan Mountain and Sanbangsan Mountain, Hwanguchi Beach and Daepyeong Sea, and Andeok Valley. Kang often depicts the same place repeatedly and sometimes spends years completing a single piece. The artworks in this part of the exhibition not only capture the beauty and dynamics of nature accumulated over time but also touch on a wide range of themes, including the destruction and wounding of the earth, contemplation and regret over endangered nature, and communication mediated by nature.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Visit</strong><br>“Visit” showcases works from Kang’s life in France and her international journeys. During this time, she traveled about every six months, starting with Mongolia and Chile in 1994, until the late 1990s. Her adventurous spirit led her to the Gobi Desert eight times and other challenging destinations such as Patagonia, Antarctica, and India, where she captured the vivid scenery that she saw. The works created in her studios in Paris and Touraine, France, subtly reflect her daily life and sentiments in this period. In her Touraine studio, which she began using in the 1990s, she created the <em>North Garden</em>, <em>Courtyard</em>, and <em>Visitation</em> series, which portray the garden and landscape there. <em>Visitation</em>, inspired by a pheasant that flew into the garden behind the studio, transforms an ordinary moment into a spiritual and artistic experience. The <em>Syria</em> series, painted in France and Jejudo, represents an artistic stand against the immense violence of war in a distant land through art. Since the 2000s, she has expanded her artistic world by engaging with numerous Chinese poets and presenting exhibitions that integrate painting and poetry.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Secret Garden</strong><br>Kang’s works from the 1960s to the 1980s are more figurative than her later pieces, often reflecting life and reality directly or in a descriptive manner. The early pieces painted after moving to France in 1972 reflect her memories of Korea and the circumstances in the country at that time. In particular, the <em>Developing Countries</em> series created in the mid-1970s includes her most vigorous criticism of the social and political reality amid the modernization of Korea. Her work then gradually shifted to a more metaphorical and implicit approach. These early pieces also serve as a key for interpreting the entire body of work. Though not included in this exhibition, <em>Secret Garden</em>, which takes the rear garden of Changdeokgung Palace as its subject, was also produced during this period. This piece demonstrates the artist’s sustained interest in nature and is characterized by a fluid movement between abstraction and figuration. It can be seen as a starting point in the artist’s artistic journey.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2025%2F&FILE_NM=20250206131957_746ba4a27a124509ac1ed2ee6080fad7_0a5285e34cad46c098c9d79c6aa551ff,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1371885,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

I myself have likened it to the experience of seeing a stranger weeping. We often see strangers smiling, but because it is rare to see a person in tears, the impact is that much greater. When we witness someone crying, we suddenly become cognizant of the very obvious fact that the life they are living is entirely separate from our own. Exhibitions are similar in that they, too, provide us with an opportunity to perceive the everyday?or simply, that which we already know?differently. The moment we enter an exhibition, we enter a world created by the mind and gaze of another person (the artist). By inserting our own bodies and axes of thought into this world constructed by the artist, we encounter new sensations and ideas. And as part of this process, we may each examine, adjust, and even rebuild our own worlds. Exhibitions are a vital medium for engaging our thinking and knowing, and the experience is unique to each one of us. Building on such properties, theorist and curator Irit Rogoff refers to exhibitions as spaces where &ldquo;events of knowledge&rdquo; take place.</p> <p>Organized under the auspices of an annual exhibition series highlighting contemporary Korean artists, <em>Ua a&lsquo;o &lsquo;ia &lsquo;o ia e ia 우아 아오 이아 오 이아 에 이아</em>, a solo exhibition by Sung Hwan Kim, invites viewers to become witnesses and agencies of the very sites where such events of knowledge occur, spread, and are manifested as praxis. At the center of the exhibition is <em>A Record of Drifting Across the Sea</em>, a multi-part research work the artist has been delving into since 2017. Beginning with the stories of early 20th century Korean immigrants to the United States who passed through Hawai&lsquo;i, <em>A Record of Drifting Across the Sea</em> expands these narratives to include issues of boundaries, tradition, documentation, and its possession and circulation, among others. Kim zeroes in on the fact that despite being situated within the larger historical narrative of modernity and colonization, the lives of many of these early immigrants have never been properly addressed in the prevailing historical narratives of Korea or the U.S. In following these lives that exist outside more widely established narratives, the artist is taking a multivalent approach to addressing the issues that surround acts of knowledge by taking stories from either side of various boundaries and weaving them together. By the same token, he also explores how systems of knowledge work to shape an individual&rsquo;s thinking and gaze.</p> <p>Here, Hawai&lsquo;i is both a concept and a specific geographic location. Beginning in the mid-19th century, with the flourishing of large-scale industrial plantations, countless overseas laborers were introduced to Hawai&lsquo;i; Chinese immigrants were followed by an influx from Japan, and then Korea, each wave shaped by the flow of capital and shifting immigration laws. The first officially documented Korean migrants were the 120 or so individuals who left Incheon Harbor in 1902, holding passports issued by the Korean Empire and arriving in Hawai&lsquo;i in 1903. This marked a turning point after which many Koreans came to settle in the mainland US via Hawai&lsquo;i. At the time, Hawai&lsquo;i was home to many who found themselves adrift, whether migrant workers hailing from Korea and elsewhere, refugees fleeing war, or native Hawaiians who had lost their ‘?ina (land) when it was forcibly annexed by the United States in 1898. Even as Hawai&lsquo;i is a concrete place where lives and cultures drift across ethnic and regional boundaries, it is also a conceptual location in which we can examine the dynamics of the various forces in play all the way through to the present day. As a metaphor, Hawai&lsquo;i serves as the chosen site for the questioning of existing knowledge systems, intersecting them with different systems of knowing, and constructing entirely new structures of knowledge. This exhibition unpacks the ways in which the knowledge is formed and disseminated, right alongside the traces that have long been relegated to the margins of such recorded history, proposing Hawai&lsquo;i as a lens through which we might consider the whole without sacrificing complexity.</p> <p dir='ltr'><strong>Unthreading (<em>parfiler*</em>)</strong></p><p>The genesis of this exhibition began with looking over the artist&rsquo;s ways of thinking. Visitors to Sung Hwan Kim&rsquo;s website will come across <u>Lessons of 1896&ndash;1907</u> (2018&ndash;), a collection of research materials collected by the artist over the past several years while working on<em>&nbsp;A Record of Drifting Across the Sea</em>. Much of this material is rooted in the artist&rsquo;s own life in Hawai&lsquo;i, as well as a journey he undertook toward the beginning of the project, driving across the western United States to visit various places once settled by early Korean immigrants, seeing, hearing, and collecting traces of the past in an attempt to touch their lives. In 2020, Kim relocated to Hawai&lsquo;i, effectively placing himself within the place of his research. The thoughts and experiences produced during this process have been categorized into eleven segmented lessons and made available on the website. These lessons are quite varied, consisting of images and texts collected and photographed by the artist, passages from books he read and excerpts from movies he watched. While these lessons may seem, at first, like straightforward products of ordinary research, they go beyond the simple collection of information to explore ways of approaching complex and knotty subject matter. By carefully unthreading the strands of the tangled object, one is able to draw out the problem and continue thinking it over, educating oneself along the way. <em>Lesson 2</em>, for example, titled <em>Surviving Moments</em>, shows multiple versions of a scene from <em>Ch?shingura</em>, a tale that has been retold in Japan since the 18th century. Alongside this, different elements like archival records of Gwanghwamun&rsquo;s many transformations from the 1900s to the present day and movie scenes depicting structures in flames are woven together to show what has survived and what has been lost in the stream of history. Looking at these objects, we ask what we ought to consider in what is shared across that which has been left behind.<em>&nbsp;Lessons</em> is more than just a mere repository for background research and information gathered to make <em>A Record of Drifting Across the Sea</em>. Rather, it is a clue to which exact aspect of reality the artist seeks to illuminate and problematize with <em>A Record of Drifting Across the Sea</em>, offering insight into his own systems of knowing, his specific point of view, and how he is handling all of the above.</p> <p><em>Ua a&lsquo;o &lsquo;ia &lsquo;o ia e ia 우아 아오 이아 오 이아 에 이아</em> is an exhibition that hopes to capture the artist&rsquo;s own experiences of witnessing and knowing in the wake of his relocation to Hawai&lsquo;i and transmit them as &ldquo;events of knowledge&rdquo; for the viewers. These are things that cannot be sensed unless one actually moves one&rsquo;s body, experiencing directly. As such, the exhibition functions like a live <em>Lesson</em> itself, emphasizing the relationship between the displayed information and the viewing body as it invites a formation of knowledge through various senses. Like the artist himself, we approach the subject matter as if unthreading the intricately tangled fabric of space-time along a multi-directional axis of knowledge.</p> <p>The exhibition itself opens with the task of looking at Hawai&lsquo;i anew. We begin by examining why <em>A Record of Drifting Across the Sea</em>, a piece that deals with issues of the knowledge system, takes Hawai&lsquo;i as its main setting. In doing so, the many different techniques of editing?including quotation, excerpt, juxtaposition, imitation, transformation, and reconstitution?and translation as metaphor emerge both as integral parts of the artist&rsquo;s primary praxis and as recurring elements threaded throughout the exhibition, which deals with the formation and proliferation of knowledge. Now here, let us return to the title of the exhibition: <em>Ua a&lsquo;o &lsquo;ia &lsquo;o ia e ia 우아 아오 이아 오 이아 에 이아</em>. Its meaning opaque without further explanation, this title intentionally juxtaposes Hawaiian and Korean phonetics without any mediating language, creating a delay in interpretation that resists immediate access and thereby opening up a space for thought?and the production of layered meaning. According to the artist, &ldquo;We can also carry meanings from one place to another by highlighting the similar elements between the two through metaphor. It is insightful to juxtapose two cultures through cross-analogy rather than through excavation or translation. One can be the metaphor of the other, and vice versa.&rdquo; In this way, what the title seeks to assert is a way of thinking about its object, emphasizing that the exhibition is not about a specific history but rather about how to approach object (history) writ large.</p> <p>The exhibition unfolds across three rooms. Starting with migration narratives that unpack modern and colonial histories, we move on to the ways in which this object (history) has been handled, fleshing out questions around the formation, ownership, and distribution of the knowledge surrounding it as we progress from one room to the next.</p> <p>In Room 1, Hawai&lsquo;i is given form by <em>Figure Complex&nbsp;</em>(2024) and reconstitutions of an exhibition curated by Drew Kahu‘?ina Broderick for the Hawai&lsquo;i Triennial 2022. Here we see a number of figures and the circumstances of the time periods in which they lived, from the early 20th century to the present day. If these seemingly unrelated images and texts have one thing in common, it is that they are all connected to Hawai&lsquo;i. Using Hawai&lsquo;i as the center, the artist weaves together disparate regions, times, cultures, historical events, and people, both longitudinally and transversely, presenting Hawai&lsquo;i as a space of complex and varied overlapping perspectives. Taking in Sung Hwan Kim&rsquo;s newly illuminated Hawai&lsquo;i as both place and as concept, we gradually begin to uncover how events and lives beyond our own seemingly unrelated borders (or systems) actually relate back to us as well. And within this process, the artist suggests thinking about such phenomena and objects, navigating the complex relationships that lie beyond the systems of knowledge to which we already belong.</p> <p>Room 2 brings our attention to the relationship between &ldquo;body and information&rdquo; by presenting art as a process through which knowledge is generated. Planning to be in residence here for the duration of the exhibition, the artist will create an artwork via variations on different extant elements of the exhibition, including video fragments, sounds, and other materials. This room, then, becomes both an exhibition space and the artist&rsquo;s editing room or studio, presenting this process as a work in its own right. This shifting grammar of the exhibition constantly moves our axis of knowledge, proposing new &ldquo;events of knowledge&rdquo; for visitors to witness. At the same time, the artist finds himself producing his work in conversation with the visitors, observing their movements and reactions as they enter the space. The visitor, then, goes from being the viewer of a finished scene to being a witness to the process of one individual&rsquo;s (the artist&rsquo;s) thought being shaped into knowledge (the work), while also being an agency, involved in the creative process. In Room 2, the properties of the exhibition as a medium for generating and spreading knowledge, as well as the process therein, constitute the main thrust of the work on display; as such, Room 2 functions as a metaphor for the nature of knowledge in flux, shaped by the structural experimentation of the exhibition, even as it questions the way in which that knowledge?which we call &ldquo;history&rdquo;?is formed. The grammar of the exhibition, which maximizes the relationship between body and information, reveals the possibility of a new kind of knowledge that can only be accessed when the axis of knowledge is shifted (when the body moves).</p> <p>Room 3 presents an installation that reimagines the 2007 video work <em>Summer Days in Keijo?written in 1937&nbsp;</em>by adding documented images, and movie footage of arson and Gwanghwamun. The installation, which spans the whole exhibition space, shows what was lost and what remains across three time periods: 1937, 2007, and 2024. Designed to continuously oscillate between what was recorded and the reality transformed by jumps in time, the exhibition speaks to the transformation and disappearance that inevitably occurs over time (history) through the duality of recording and distortion inherent to mediums like exhibition and film. This attempt, on the part of the artist, to revitalize works completed in the past by bringing them into the present also represents his ongoing use of imitation and transformation to question our ever-changing knowledge. And this, in turn, reminds us once more that for Sung Hwan Kim, an &ldquo;artwork&rdquo; is not the result of a fixed thought about an object, but rather the gaze that approaches a changing object, and a way of thinking.</p> <p dir='ltr'><strong>Witness is a Mode of Knowledge Exchange</strong></p><p>It happened last summer, during a visit to Hawai&lsquo;i. I had the chance to visit some, if not all, of the locations that appear in <em>A Record of Drifting Across the Sea</em>, and even meet some of the individuals involved. The experience of physically moving through the real world created a space in which I could reflect on the objects I had previously encountered in archival form, or as a work by the artist, in relation to my own experience. When I realized after the fact that a building named &ldquo;Younghee&rdquo; I had stumbled across after a wrong turn had once been home to a number of early Korean immigrants, and when I realized that the road I&rsquo;d just passed was one of the areas slated for redevelopment I&rsquo;d seen in the Pili?mo‘o series, a wave of other temporalities and narratives that I had come to know through Kim&rsquo;s work began rushing in, creating new and different landscapes. This journey, which allowed me the opportunity to trace my fingers along invisible times and people and lives, was also an experience where those things shown to me by the artist&rsquo;s work came to life as my own. Easily the most transformative event of the trip, for me, was a keynote lecture by Dr. Manulani Aluli Meyer given as a precursor to the Hawai&lsquo;i Triennial 2025, in which the important Hawaiian philosopher and educator interpreted the Triennial&rsquo;s theme of &ldquo;ALOHA N?&rdquo; on many different levels, drawing from her own lived experience. Claiming aloha as the source of all values, Dr. Aluli Meyer spoke of decolonizing knowledge, explaining that while Western philosophy and science would have us believe that the world is controlled by humanity, in reality, &ldquo;the world is self-organizing, and because it is self-organizing, witnessing then becomes a higher frequency of knowledge exchange.&rdquo; The biggest realization this sentence bestowed upon me concerns how to conceive of the act of witness. Before this, witnessing, for me, had been more of a passive experience, as in simply watching an event or situation unfold. What Dr. Aluli Meyer spoke of, however, was witness as an act of knowledge exchange. What is more, she helped me to see that witness is not encompassed in any one individual experience; rather, it is an active experience, shared with others?and when many such acts come together, they can even form a kind of collective knowledge.</p> <p><em>Ua a&lsquo;o &lsquo;ia &lsquo;o ia e ia 우아 아오 이아 오 이아 에 이아</em>, too, seeks to address issues of knowledge through this experience of active &ldquo;witness.&rdquo; Starting from the artist&rsquo;s own questions and journey, the exhibition has itself undergone several transformations and edits as it made its way to you. And indeed, we plan for these processes of exchange and transformation to continue throughout the exhibition. Upon this fluid, floating ground, the artist&rsquo;s journey and gaze will be followed by the curator, and this, in turn, followed by your own, creating a chain of witness upon witness within which we might find the opportunity to reflect upon what, exactly, is at work in our knowing, and how we might approach it. This is, at least, our hope.</p> <p>* This was borrowed from an excerpt in <em>Neutral</em> by Roland Barthes that appears under the &ldquo;intent&rdquo; section of the <em>Lessons</em>.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2024%2F&FILE_NM=20241126112930_b766af11eb154f0f8460e30beb3ca38b_981d09911af448cdb4003e40081e7655,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1354166,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

1356160,552,Park Kwang Jin: Whispers of Nature,,Seosomun Main Branch,2024-12-12,2025-02-09,,,"Organized Seoul Museum of Art, Cooperated with Korean Government Art Bank(MMCA), Supported by Samhwa",,,"Drawing, Painting, Archive etc",117,Park Kwang Jin,,"<p dir='ltr'><strong><em>Whispers of Nature as Resonance: Exploring New Possibilities in Korean Figurative Painting</em></strong></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) presents<em>&nbsp;Park Kwang Jin: Whispers of Nature</em>, opening at the close of 2024 while awaiting the arrival of spring and the beginning of new life. Born in 1935, Park Kwang Jin is an artist who is viewed as having played a pivotal role in the progression and advancement of figurative painting in Korea. He first attracted notice as a Western painting student at Hongik University in 1957, when his work&nbsp;National Treasure&nbsp;was honored as a special selection at the 6th National Art Exhibition (<em>Gukjeon</em>). He was also a founding member of <em>Mokwoohoe</em>, a group that laid the groundwork for academism and the systematic growth of Korean figurative painting. In 1965, he established the Sunday Artists Society, which pursued outdoor sketching activities. He took part in the National Documentary Painting project, and he remains active today as a member of the National Academy of Arts.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>In the painting world, Park is well known for his detailed depictions in a realistic style. His mature works from the 21st century, however, show him progressing in leaps and bounds beyond that stage, with a <em>sui generis</em> body of work combining realistic landscapes with geometric elements. The exhibition title <em>Whispers of Nature</em> originates from an interview in which the artist said, “ It may seem like nature is soundless, but I can hear. It’s just a question of how to represent that.”<sup>[1]</sup> Here, the artist describes his contemplation on how to transport the sounds of nature onto canvas. Like an old Zen Buddhist monk’s koan, it seems difficult to comprehend at first; what meaning does it hold in terms of Park’s artistic <em>œuvre</em>?</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>Park Kwang Jin has made significant contributions while holding various roles within the art world: a professor at Seoul National University of Education (SNUE), chairperson of the Korean Fine Arts Association, vice president of the International Association of Art (IAA), and more. However, rather than his roles as an educator and administrator, this exhibition focuses on Park’s pure, creative artistic journey spanning seven decades.<sup>[2]</sup> Throughout his life until the present, Park has created around 1,100 works of art; this exhibition features 117 of them, including pieces from the SeMA collection and a selection of the artist’s most representative works. It is divided into four themes?“Exploration: Figures, Still Lifes, Landscapes”; “Landscape of Choices”; “Seasonal Reflections”; and “Sound of Nature”?designed so that visitors can gain an understanding of the progression and expansion of Park’s artistic vision based on the various strands of exploration that he pursued simultaneously.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>The first section, entitled “Exploration: Figures, Still Lifes, Landscapes,” covers Park’s search for artistic direction while working with a variety of different subjects, beginning with his first oil painting, <em>Entrance to Changgyeongwon Park</em> (1952). Park was influenced by pioneering Korean figurative artists such as Lee Bongsang, Son Eungsung, and Park Sookeun, who played a key role in opening new horizons in modern Korean figurative art. Through these influences, Park sought new artistic directions in his work, exploring various subjects. The next section, “Landscape of Choices,” surveys the different scenes that he discovered with his artistic perspective as his focus shifted increasingly to landscape painting. Between 1967 and the 1990s, Park expanded his œuvre by painting the beauty of rural communities and urban surroundings and paying visits to scenic locations around the world.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>“Seasonal Reflections”&nbsp;presents landscape paintings created between the mid-1960s and 1990s in which the artist realistically captured Korea’s pure nature. Park’s later work focuses purely on nature, while adding elements of the artist’s subjective impressions; in this sense, these works serve as a pivotal bridge&nbsp;in his artistic journey. Park has made a conscious effort to seek out examples of untouched nature, to the extent that he mentions specific geographic locations in the titles of his works. His artistic expression and the realism of his work are heightened by his exquisite depictions of light. In his paintings of Korea’s scenery through the four seasons, he clearly captures changes in the light from one moment to the next as he represents its natural beauty in detail. In particular, his landscapes depicting natural settings as reflected in bodies of water may be seen as the quintessence of his creative output during this period: through his simultaneous rendering of the actual landscape features and their reverse images, he expands the spatial sense, while ripples on the water’s surface heighten the effect of the light and add visual depth.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>The final section, “Sounds of Nature,” presents works from the period after the 1990s, when Park shifted his attention to the silver grass and canola flowers growing in the distinctive environment of Jeju Island, which has become like a second home to him. During this phase, he sought to explore new possibilities in figurative art, aiming to “show not simply depictions, but canvases upon which the subjects of nature are condensed and concentrated.”<sup>[3]</sup> In these works, the foreground is filled with delicate brushstrokes depicting silver grass, while the background elements are either omitted or simplified, capturing the light and wind of Jeju’s autumn, as if viewed through a brownish filter.<sup>[4]</sup> The artist also introduced thin vertical lines onto his canvas, taking inspiration from the canola fields of France’s Metz area and the stripe patterns found in the work of Jesus Rafael Soto (1923&ndash;2005), whose work he encountered at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. Each vertical line represents the sound of an individual element, like musical notes in different phases, and their repetition expresses the rhythms and beats unique to natural phenomena. Another distinctive feature of some works is the treatment of the near distance: while mountains and trees in the background retain their forms, the closer landscape loses its shape, becoming an undifferentiated mass. This fascinating approach has been described as representing the application of color field abstraction to the naturalist painting that Park has explored throughout his life, showing a unique aesthetic in which the abstract coexists with the realistic.<sup>[5]</sup> The artist himself has said that he has “never forgotten for a moment that I am a figurative artist,”<sup>[6]</sup> which leaves room for interpreting this technique as an extension of figurative painting. Considering his history of enlarging certain portions and depicting their textures in minute detail?an approach seen in earlier works such as<em>&nbsp;Pagoda in Topgol Park</em> (1957) and <em>Pagoda</em> (1968)?this undifferentiated mass may be understood as the monochrome pixels on the surface of a canola flower seen when the gaze is intensely fixed on an object in the foreground. The method used in Park’s works, such as<em>&nbsp;Rabbit Hutch</em> (1962), where space is divided by the rectangular frame of a livestock pen, may represent the origin of the artist’s compositions, in which a dramatic contrast is achieved by segmenting and reconfiguring the entire scene to leave only the distant view and the extreme foreground. This composition creates a profound impression by giving the canvas a more condensed feel.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p>From figurative painting genres such as still life, portrait, and landscape to a focus on the pure nature within landscapes, Park Kwang Jin’s lifelong artistic journey shifted from realistic depictions of nature to the expression of condensed and concentrated forms. In some ways, his life’s work comes across as an answer to the “whispers of nature,” rendered in images on the canvas. Park himself reflectively noted, “Figuration requires endless self-metamorphosis, and I haven’t been making those kinds of efforts.”<sup>[7]</sup> As this statement reveals, his responses are the results of ceaseless contemplation and transformation. What is the future of Korean figurative painting in a climate such as today’s, where abstract painting has become representative of Korean art amid the wave of popularity enjoyed by<em>&nbsp;Dansaekhwa</em> since 2010<sup>[8]</sup> and debates are raging over the artistry of paintings produced with AI technology? Here, the activities of a soon-to-be-nonagenarian artist come across as something more resounding than a whisper.</p><p><br></p><p><span style='font-size: 14px;'>[1] Seoul Museum of Art, interview with Park Kwang Jin at his studio in Seoul’s Seocho-gu, October5, 2023.</span></p><p><span style='font-size: 14px;'>[2] The forthcoming exhibition <em>Park Kwang Jin: Whispers of Nature</em> is being established as a chronology of Park’s lifetime of work in the art world.</span></p><p><span style='font-size: 14px;'>[3] Kim Dongseong, “[Recent Events] A World of Thoughts Transformed into Apprehensions: Park Kwang Jin Holds First Seoul Solo Exhibition in 24 Years,” <em>Art World</em>, November 2001, 111.</span></p><p><span style='font-size: 14px;'>[4] To fully capture the coarseness of the silver grass, Park used a specially treated canvas purchased in France, which had the proper red clay tone and texture.</span></p><p><span style='font-size: 14px;'>[5] Lee Kyeong-eun, “On the Opening of Park Gwang-jin &amp; Alain Bonnefoit Exhibition <em>The Light of of Jeju, the Color of Paris</em>,” in <em>The Light of Jeju, the Color of Paris: Park Gwang-jin &amp; Alain Bonnefoit</em>, exhibition catalog (Jeju Museum of Contemporary Art, 2018), 8; Chung Yeon Shim, “Sounds of Light and Wind: Naturalist Figurative Paintings of Park Kwangjin,” in <em>Park Kwang Jin: Facing Nature</em>, exhibition catalog (Hongik University Museum, 2024), 16; Kim Yisoon, “Portraits of Nature Nurtured through the Resonance of the Figurative and Abstract: Park Kwang Jin’s Landscape Paintings of the Beauty of Old Villages and Landscapes” (2024), 1.</span></p><p><span style='font-size: 14px;'>[6] Kim Dongseong, “[Recent Events] A World of Thoughts Transformed into Apprehensions,” 111.</span></p><p><span style='font-size: 14px;'>[7] Oh Sang-Ghil,<em>&nbsp;Rereading Contemporary Korean Art V</em> (ICAS, 2018), 419.</span></p><p><span style='font-size: 14px;'>[8] Chung Yeon Shim, “Sounds of Light and Wind: Naturalist Figurative Paintings of Park Kwangjin,” 8.</span></p><p><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2025%2F&FILE_NM=20250123095311_d1b2e4a3692a4a2c91da0e2b64facd8b_5d691609af2649a082f9554154bb8487,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1356160,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
509315,464,Lee Bul - Beginning,,Seosomun Main Branch,2021-03-02,2021-05-16,,,Seoul Museum of Art / Supported by Herm&#232;s Korea,,,,,Lee Bul,,"<p><em>Lee Bul??Beginning</em> is an exhibition focusing on the internationally renowned artist Lee Bul’s first decade of artistic development, during which her 'soft sculpture' and performance works were produced extensively. From the late 1980s to the 1990s, when Lee was in her twenties and at the start of her career, South Korea was at a historical turning point. This was a period when the drive toward democratization was being displaced by the rising tides of globalization, consumerism, and popular culture, and fin-de-si?cle anxieties alternated with hopes for the new century. Within this historical context, the exhibition centers on Lee's early performances, presenting a range of rarely seen formative works, studies, mock-ups and archival material, as well as related sculptures and drawings, that shed light on her artistic ideas and processes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Delving into the contradictions of beauty and ugliness, life and death, mind and body, light and shadow, Lee Bul’s work is known for its deployment of visual and conceptual motifs that interrogate the body, male-centric legacies of modernism, and ideologies that have shaped Korea’s modernization. And projected through the prism of politics, gender, race, and class, such contradictory meanings generated by her work traverse the boundaries of received ideas. This exhibition revisits the artist’s beginning to create a tension between two perspectives anchored in the past and the present―not only enriching interpretations of Lee Bul’s artistic practice to date but also enabling the viewer to transpose upon it questions that remain relevant in the contemporary world. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Lee Bul’s formative works can be read largely through three perspectives―“the female body,” “the cultural-political space” and “the exterior of modernity.” The body, the female body, in particular, was central to Lee’s formative practice as both subject and material. With<em>&nbsp;Cravings&nbsp;</em>(1988?1989), presented at her first solo exhibition in 1988, the artist devised a performance of improvised movements and sounds while wearing full-body sculptures made of fabric, fiberfill, and ornamental sequins. This marked the beginning of her “soft sculptures,” which would evolve and expand―through formal investigations of the body, distorted, reconfigured, and transformed―into later sculptural works that continued to contravene existing conceptions of gender and the body.</p><p><br></p><p>From the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, Lee Bul carried out both exhibition-making and performance, participating in numerous exhibitions and performance festivals. While continuing her formal experimentation with the transformation of the body, she broadened the scope of her practice and developed a distinctive artistic language through highly charged performances that came off as a series of detonations in the existing art scene. Representative performances from this period―<em>The Song of the Fish</em> (1990), <em>Artoilet II&nbsp;</em>(1990), <em>Diagramming III</em> (1992), <em>Auction</em> (1994), and <em>Laughing</em> (1994)―generated a kind of visual syntax of irony.</p><p><br></p><p>In 1997, when Lee Bul was invited by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, to exhibit in the museum’s Projects series, she mounted an installation of raw fish adorned with sequins titled <em>Majestic Splendor</em> (1991/1997). This turned out to be a fraught yet pivotal moment for the artist, as the work was taken down before the opening due to its inescapable smell, which permeated the upstairs galleries of this supreme modernist institution. Along with other organic materials subject to decomposition, fish had often appeared in Lee’s performances and installations, loaded as it was as a traditional symbol of birth, fertility, and womanhood that her work sought to deconstruct. The accidental confrontation with the aesthetic conventions and hierarchies represented by what is perhaps the world’s pre-eminent modern art museum was in line with the compelling contingency of Lee Bul’s performative works.</p><p><br></p><p>Gathering essential video and photographic documentation of Lee Bul’s performances, the exhibition also presents a wealth of previously unseen drawings, preparatory objects, and studies. Accompanying this exhibition, a monographic publication surveying the artist’s early practice will be published in 2021.</p><p><br></p><p>For further information, please contact Jin Kwon <u>nakwonjin@seoul.go.kr</u></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Exhibition Identity by mhtl, 2021</p><p><br></p><p>Artwork Image from</p><p>Lee Bul, <em>Artoilet II,&nbsp;</em>1990, Performance, Space Theater, Seoul.

The artists closely observe a world shaped by the intersecting forces of climate issue, war, and technological rivalry. Sensitively attuned to the global crisis hurtling toward collapse, they develop material thinking that is processed through their own bodies. Through this, they present bold, large-scale new works that reveal a fresh approach to “response-ability,” maintaining a sense of responsibility toward the entangled relationship between the “self” and “all beings on Earth.”<br><br>The direct translation of the exhibition title is “Stone and Night.” The motifs of “stone” and “night” are not only central to each artist’s focus but also represent broader concepts: “night” represents a metaphor for disaster and “stone” embodies a perpetually transforming body and a sense of connection between oneself and other beings. The two artists weave these ideas together with remarkable sincerity and candor.<br><br>Hong Lee, Hyunsook expands on her recent exploration of the “stone” motif with <em>Ami-dong Tombstone Village</em> (2024), a video work that contemplates the possibility of solidarity beyond ethnicity, nationhood, life, and death amidst reactionary circumstances such as global conflicts and the rise of refugees. She also brings <em>What you are touching now-Insubong</em> (2024), a frottage installation resembling the skin of a boulder, into a towering 10-meter exhibition space to evoke the tactile reality of the climate crisis and relationships with non-human entities. By polishing gravestones and rocks, the artist metaphorically explores how our interwoven existence allows us to understand the “other” through the gesture of “self-touching.” Visitors can also view a series of eleven video works in Project Gallery 1, which are considered the foundation of these new creations.<br><br>Ji Hye Yeom draws on the motif of “night” to contemplate the rapid pace of the contemporary world, driven by the desire to reclaim lost time for growth during the pandemic. She questions whether this seamless, high-speed trajectory is ultimately heading toward calamity. In <em>The Last Night</em> (2024) and <em>The Midday Symptoms</em> (2024), Yeom captures visceral sensations of acceleration, exhaustion, foreboding signs, and helplessness. Departing from her earlier works, which often relied on montages and 3D imagery to evoke and metaphorize bodily sensations, she experiments with cinematic forms rooted in on-site shooting. Alongside Yeom’s video works, she introduces a book and paintings that expand on the narrative universe of the films, channeling energy away from rapidity and towards a shift in direction.<br><br>This exhibition also features a sound work created with the voices of both artists. Through an exchange of short texts rooted in their respective concerns, the artists dismantle the framework of confrontation, engage in dialogue, and explore the notion of performativity that fosters mutual transformation.<br><br>The English title of this exhibition is <em>Fold the Time with the Ground</em>. True to the title, Hong Lee, Hyunsook folds time and the ground, traversing like a wolf to embrace and stand beside the marginalized and excluded across the wide expanse of the world. Ji Hye Yeom folds and creases time and space to delay the moment rushing toward catastrophe, and envisions another possibility of metamorphosis, like a blue crayfish shedding its shell. Their journeys, which seem to embody both sensory exteriors and intuitive interiors, resonate through physical and material forms. As beings bound to the Earth, their works offer hope that we might each find strength to struggle, console, and persevere in our own ways amidst the crises we face.<br><br>“Good Luck, All of Us”<br>- Ji Hye Yeom</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2024%2F&FILE_NM=20241122135311_a91ef9e3d7d141f4a6f06eed852b7665_3291e1b1a2844706975e8bad625308ac,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1353101,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Adopting the omnibus form of storytelling that weaves independent short stories around a single theme, four different yet closely connected exhibitions are held at four locations: <em>At the End of the World Split Endlessly</em> (Seosomun Main Branch), <em>I Want to Love Us</em> (Buk-Seoul Museum of Art), <em>Planet Nine</em> (Nam-Seoul Museum of Art), and <em>Fantasia of the Archive</em> (Art Archives). It will be an opportunity to sense the dynamics and diversity of Korean contemporary art, where the characteristic keywords of the SeMA collection such as contemporaneity and female artists are discovered like a hidden object game.</p><p><br></p><p><em>At the End of the World Split Endlessly</em> attempts to read the SeMA collection through the keywords of connection and combination between media. It is an exhibition that explores the inevitable structure of artists and their works through medium in the post-medium/post-media era, showing the multi-layered structure of medium/media of our time created by media that respond to technological and social changes such as old media and new media, virtual and real, AI and the body. The etymology of the word medium comes from the Greek words medium which means middle, and medius which means in between. In contemporary art, medium acts as a vehicle, a conduit, a psychic, and a connection, constituting layers of complex linkages that connect the work and the artist, the work and the viewer, and the viewer and the art museum. Following the keywords of the exhibition such as Old &amp; New, Yellow Block, Layered Medium, and Open End as though clicking through them, one can see that the situation of the medium of the here and now exists as a multi-layered structure that is both singular and plural.</p><p><br></p><p>As the title of the exhibition that was inspired by anthropologist Anna Tsing’s <em>The Mushroom at the End of the World</em> and Jorge Luis Borges’ novel <em>The Garden of Forking Paths</em>, artists are asking through their art, where we stand at the end of the world, in the midst of the climate crisis and the end of capitalism. Just as artists create works of art after going through various degrees of consideration over the process of selecting and renewing their medium, we paradoxically dream of new connections in an endlessly splitting world. It is not a perfectly seamless connection, but a connection that is already partial and broken. Art is telling us to take another look at this very imperfection and insufficiency, about the life, reflection, resistance, hope, imagination, and latent possibilities that still stir in the ruins of the wreckage.</p><p><br></p><p>○ Introduction of the Sections</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Part 1: SeMA Collections Read through Medium</strong></p><p dir='ltr'>The museum's collections are expansively viewed as objects based on flexibility that are constantly moving and changing/navigating, rather than as fixed works of art to be preserved for future generations. Collections already have an ambivalent nature, not only as fixed, physical entities such as physical works, storage units, and management cards, but also as constructs of fluid, immaterial data such as collection search engines, images, and databases. With the diversification of contemporary art, the collections of art museums are not limited to the methods of collecting, preserving, or utilizing modern collections, but are open to the possibility of being newly established in conjunction with technological and social changes such as digital media, big data, artificial intelligence, and block chain. We propose the collection as a point of contact as well as a medium of connection that mediates the operation of the work and the artist, the work and the viewer, and the viewer and the art museum.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><strong>Part 2: Old and New</strong></p><p dir='ltr'>Understanding medium as a combination of technical conditions and conventions rather than a simple material foundation such as canvas or paint, the SeMA collection is examined within the categories of medium (painting, Korean painting, sculpture, installation, photography, printmaking &amp; drawing, design). Medium categorization ironically reveals how interconnected and mutually referential such categories are. Painting complements and expands drawing, sculpture complements and expands installation, and photography complements and expands video. It reflects the contemporaneity of the medium in which old media and new media, and virtuality and handcraft coexist in colorful layers. An artist selecting a medium takes place not only in response to the form of the work, but also by the necessity of its content, new experiments and attempts on the medium, and changes in society and technology. Through medium in the post-media era, we not only think about the creative mechanism that projects changes within art, society, and technology, but also the reality of medium of this era that we are facing.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><strong>Part 3: Yellow Block</strong></p><p dir='ltr'>As the novel by Borges that went beyond the concept of absolute and uniform space and time and talked about fortuitous and relative time, this section goes beyond the linear concept of collections where art resonates with the past and records it for the future. Past, present, and future events are summoned to the here and now based on the Block Time theory, which states that events from all time periods, past, present, and future, coexist in various layers. In particular, it showcases the diverse use of medium by emerging artists, and functions as an inter-media box that presents various thoughts on medium by holding talks and workshops within the exhibition hall.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><strong>Part 4: Layered Medium</strong></p><p dir='ltr'>Highlights the layered realities of medium such as superimposition, hybrid, blending, and remix. It explores how a dynamic rhizomatic system that diversifies difference and plurality is hidden within the medium of the collection. Artists continuously weave the fragments of society, history, politics, and disasters that surround them into sensations, language, and aesthetic order. As it becomes possible to newly participate in the collection that is constantly summoned to the present, they are discovered as a new event in the sediments of time. The collection is constantly updated, becoming a 'present' that contains both the past and the future.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p data-empty='true'><strong>Part 5: Open End</strong></p><p dir='ltr'>Engages in open practice through connections with new medium. The focus is on the ability to ask new questions, and whether it is possible to discover the moments in which the potential is revealed in the networking between humans and objects, and animals and non-humans, such as the ability to create prompts in the AI era. To this end, we suggest a time for the viewers to experience the work themselves. Just as Kubo the novelist found his own path as he walked the streets of Gyeongseong 100 years ago amidst the era's flood of new culture and the weight of social censorship, we today participate in that open ending.</p><p><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2024%2F&FILE_NM=20240820121335_e18808cad05c4bdabecbb6c798a6855d_f96e322f4e424dcca650e37bb92d12ee,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1319672,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The exhibition<em>&nbsp;Fantasia of the Archives</em>, presented by Art Archives SeMA, aims to provide a channel to conjure up the artists’ past works and envisage a new path, inviting audiences to explore a broader scope of the SeMA collection by excavating archives and artworks. The artists’ notes containing behind-the-scenes stories, references they referred to, photographs they tested, drawings and maquettes they used for pre-production allow us to imagine how much time and effort they put into the creative process. The archive is a record from the past, but it remains present in that the artists’ endless ideas physically appear in the work, and it will continue to inspire artistic and creative minds towards the future. This chronological concept of the archive, traversing past, present, and future time, is reminiscent of the ‘fantasia’ Michel Foucault once experienced in the book-filled library. Just as Foucault considered the library as a new space of wonders and as a phenomenon of blossoming imagination, this exhibition proposes the Art Archives as a space of artistic imagination.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Fantasia of the Archives</em> summons six artists from the SeMA collection, including KWAK Namsin, SON Kwang-Ju, YOON Kalim, LEE Kyojun, IM Sunyi, and CHUN Kook-kwang. It unfolds the record of the past, the voice of the present, and the imagination that lies in the future. Across various media such as painting, video, photography, and sculpture, the artists project their unique worldviews into their works that sit on the boundaries and interstices of the past and present, the real and the illusory, abstraction and figuration. Here, the archive will lead audiences to a creative universe of each artist. The exhibition examines the original context of the works by connecting the gaze and time of the artists with those of the audiences. <em>Fantasia of the Archives</em> does not attempt to re-contextualize the collection.

Valuing the aesthetics of realism, she expressed the social realities of Korean women through her art. While engaged in the women’s liberation movement, she discovered “a healthy beauty that changes society” and explored femininity. Kim emphasized the positive power and vitality of women and sought to establish an indigenous Korean feminist art using national figurative languages. In 2020, Kim In Soon gifted 106 artworks from her Yangpyeong studio to the Seoul Museum of Art to support the study of Korean feminist art and the preservation of art historical records. The gifted works include 96 of her pieces and 10 banner paintings co-created by the Women’s Art Research Society (1986&ndash;95), the women’s art group Dungji (1987&ndash;89), and the Labor Art Committee (1990&ndash;92), which were active in the women’s art movement.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;font-size:15px;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size: 24px;'><br></span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;font-size:15px;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size: 24px;'><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;'>The KIM In Soon Collection is a vital resource that showcases the development of Korean feminist art. Influenced by the women’s movement of the 1980s, female artists created works that spoke to the realities of women's lives. Kim initiated the<em>&nbsp;October Gathering&nbsp;</em>- <em>From Half to Whole</em> (1986), recorded as the first feminist exhibition in Korea. She organized the Women’s Art Research Society and the women’s art group Dungji to depict the realities faced by women in a patriarchal society. Furthermore, she delved into the unique value of women’s experiences, and emphasis on “motherhood,” likening the existence of women who produce and nurture life even in harsh environments to ‘roots.’ As a founding member of the National Art Association in 1985, she was deeply concerned with class realities, women's labor, and childcare. Also, she explored “history,” “unification,” and “national landscapes” from a woman’s perspective. The Collection encompasses the breadth of Korean women’s history and the context of Korean feminist art, including works from the annual exhibition <em>Women and Reality</em> (1987&ndash;94).&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;font-size:15px;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size: 24px;'><br></span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;font-size:15px;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size: 24px;'><strong class=''><span style='font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;'>Exhibition Layout&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;font-size:15px;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size: 24px;'><br></span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;font-size:15px;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size: 24px;'><em><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;'>Rise</span></em><em><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;'>&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;'>Up</span></em><em><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;'>&nbsp;for Life</span></em><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;'>&nbsp;explores Kim In Soon’s artistic engagement with the theme of women.

In any highly competitive neoliberal society, the problems faced by minorities are often treated as secondary or not recognized as problems at all, and attempts at collectivization frequently fall apart. On the other hand, even when minorities are collectivized through social welfare policies or collectivized to assert their rightful place in society, individual lives are overlooked, and only the aspects of the collective identity that society expects are reduced to “a single story.” Minorities need collectivization to eliminate oppression and discrimination, but they face the paradox in which individual diversity is erased during the process of unification in and among minority groups. This exhibition aims to demonstrate ways to include the diversity of individuals without collectivizing minorities. Through art, it seeks ways for vulnerable individuals to affirm themselves and find love for the “us” composed of individuals with unique bodies and minds. Instead of categorizing the works by specific identities, the exhibition focuses on the shared experiences of social minorities. Furthermore, it explores the possibility of individuals uniting while respecting each other's diversity.</p><p><br></p><p>* The title of this exhibition is borrowed from the book <em>Minor Feelings</em>, with permission from Cathy Park Hong and Jeff Chang.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>[Image Description]</strong></p><p>Oksun Kim, <em>No Direction Home_Serah's Family</em>, 2010, SeMA Collection.</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>In a home decorated with light brown wood, four family members are positioned around a wooden display cabinet filled with various family memorabilia and photographs, all facing the camera.

Inspired by the classical facade arch, the main architectural feature of the Seoul Museum of Art, the work creates a new awareness of the place by drawing the movement of the viewers itself into the work.

In the fable the artist himself has created, we are confronted with the earnest desire of humans for salvation, their blind and mad faith, and the sense of disconnect that eventually returns when we are faced with the anxiety of reality. Through this project, objects such as a fox scarf, an animal’s tail, a bat, a mushroom and 'leather paintings' made on the inner skin of leather become unfamiliar objects that encounter the viewers throughout the museum.</p><p><br></p><p>○ Choi Soo Jung, <em>Invitation to a Journey: Madison County X_ Blue Rock Desert 1999,</em> 2024</p><p><br></p><p>Choi Soo Jung experiments with the conditions of traditional painting -the canvas- and with the painting methods to overcome it. <em>Invitation to a Journey</em>(2024), the title inspired by Baudelaire’s poem, is a work that spatially expands and reinterprets <em>Madison County X</em>(2023), which was presented as a monument to intense memory, and <em>Blue Rock Desert 1999,</em> which evokes the event of the journey to the desert, using 3D printing and diffraction films. The work is newly presented in the museum’s lobby space on the right side.

Unlike the past, where unchanging universal values prevailed, unstable daily life has become the “new normal” in this age where constant change is the only truth. People now feel the weightlessness of existence more than ever, drifting as algorithms guide them through the digital landscape, which has become another facet of normalcy. In this reality, we ponder what we can rely on to alleviate anxiety and avoid succumbing to depression and emptiness. We contemplate how to reclaim vital aspects of life, such as communication, symbiosis, peace, and happiness, which seem to be slipping away. Perhaps it's time to summon the Genie of the lamp and make a wish.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'><br>The exhibition features eight artists who act as 'guides,' presenting new stories and wisdom across two parts. The first section showcases artists demonstrating how societal phenomena, like individual anxieties and isolation, can be transformed into communication, reconciliation, and symbiosis, often through entities resembling 'ghosts' from folklore, myths, and fairy tales. Artworks from the first four guides offer direction Make A Wish to drifting humans, sharing life wisdom through unique narratives that serve as portals between realms, from reality to spiritual realms, and from conflict to healing. Naomi creates a magical space bridging past and present, humanity and divinity, with a focus on disappearing elements. Zadie Xa and Heesoo Kwon explore alterity from a feminist perspective, drawing from Korean mythology, folklore, and shamanism to depict transcendent yet wise beings in painting and 3D animation. Dabal Kim seeks to blur the boundaries between binary gender identities, aiming to fuse body and clothing.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'><br></p><p style='text-align: justify;'>The second section showcases artists exploring how to rediscover meaning in a world that often feels weightless, addressing internal struggles. Another four artists propose practical methods, reminiscent of granting wishes like the Genie from the lamp. They illustrate, through fervent wishes and prayers, not only ways to alleviate anxiety and emptiness but also practical steps towards personal and collective happiness and fulfillment. Geunyoung Hong presents an alchemy of transforming viewers' unhappiness into symbols of good fortune using clay sculptures. Min Shin offers a large figurine where viewers can attach their wishes, fostering introspection into themselves and their connections with others. Wonwoo Lee presents a sculpture evoking Greco-Roman times, using cotton candy to remind modern individuals, accustomed to weakened human contact and materialistic consumption, of the important values they risk losing. Hansaem Kim encourages viewers to confront real-world challenges by juxtaposing them with the fantasy of a hero's salvation depicted in images reminiscent of RPG video games or religious iconography, suggesting that even in an era of lightness that may leave us feeling hollow and empty, we have the ability to confront and overcome our own problems, much like heroes, ultimately saving ourselves.</p><p style='text-align: justify;'><br>This exhibition, presented as a 'spiritual journey,' aims to illustrate the belief that despite life's fleeting nature, humans can uphold dignity and inward freedom. It is hoped that the stories initiated by the artists will resonate with the personal narratives, myths, and heartfelt aspirations of the audience, eventually evolving into wisdom passed down through generations.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2024%2F&FILE_NM=20240424165548_575a890d13074c2095e8858ded09040c_784d3be1cfa5448ca9f16c83ccdeff58,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1283374,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

This 2024 exhibition offers on view works by CHUN and 22 women artists who were her contemporaries, as well as materials related to their lives.</p><p>CHUN was born and grew up in the Japanese colonial period. Driven by her love of drawing since young age, CHUN left her home country where she could not find official art schools at the time, and moved to Japan to pursue her art studies by enrolling at Private Women’s School of Fine Arts in Tokyo, Japan, in 1941. In 1943, while she was a student there, CHUN won an award in the 22<sup>nd</sup> Joseon Art Exhibition for her work <em>Grandfather</em>. In the same year, CHUN’s studies were cut short by the Pacific Wars (1941-45), leading to her graduation in the fall of that year. CHUN wished to remain in Japan to focus on her art, but returned to Korea as the war was almost at its end. Upon her return, she won a prize for her work <em>Old Woman</em> at the 23<sup>rd</sup> <em>Joseon Art Exhibition</em> in 1944, the last one to be held.</p><p>In Spring 1945, CHUN married Lee Hyung-sik who had supported her when she moved back to Korea, and in August the same year, CHUN celebrated the independence of Korea in her home town of Goheung, Jeollanam-do. However, her husband Lee had lied to CHUN about his education and family background before they were married, and was not competent enough to provide for his family. Therefore, CHUN had to make a living for her family, working as an art teacher at her alma mater and raising her children with the help of her mother, at times nursing her children at the school. There, CHUN had the opportunity to show in a solo exhibition organized by the school, and in celebration, invited journalists to her place. This is how she met Kim Nam-joong, and fell in long tormenting love with him. The Korean War broke out in June 25<sup>th</sup> 1950, and CHUN lost contact with her husband Lee Hyung-sik. Living in poverty, CHUN’s younger sister Ok-hee passed away due to recurring Tuberculosis caused by malnutrition. CHUN painted <em>Ecology</em> (1951) to endure her suffering. CHUN painted to make money for a living, and moved throughout the province of Jeollanamdo to sell her works. Then, with the armistice signed in July 1953, and the government's return to Seoul as the capital, CHUN became a full-time lecturer at Hongik University's College of Fine Arts in 1954 on the recommendation of Yoon Hyo-jung, who was the Dean of the Department at the time. In June the following year, CHUN was prized the Presidential Award at the <em>7<sup>th</sup> Korea Art Association Exhibition</em>, and was selected as a special artist at the <em>4<sup>th</sup> National Art Exhibition</em> in October that year, firmly grounding her recognition as an artist.</p><p>At that time, the most pressing issue in the world of Oriental Painting was the question of constructing the “Korean Painting” which reflects the unique characteristics of Korea. Since the Joseon Dynasty, Oriental Painting predominantly took on landscape in the Southern school of Chinese painting style. However, Oriental Painting in Korea began to take on Japanese Painting in style when Japan promoted realistic sketching style in the <em>Joseon Art Exhibition</em> series, which was implemented as part of their cultural politics in the Japanese colonial period. Therefore, upon the liberation of Korea, the artists at the time bound themselves to Korean materials, subject matters, and techniques in order to break away from Japanese painting style and carry out the ambiguous mission of establishing “Korean Painting” that is unique to Korea. However, CHUN stood out from her contemporaries in that she did not confine her works to the framework of Oriental or Korean Painting from the beginning. Although most artists produced ink-and-wash paintings at the time, in the biased conviction that color paintings are essentially Japanese, CHUN indulged in creating color paintings.</p><p>Even when CHUN taught her pupils, she never enforced any specific frameworks on them, but instead respected their own ways and work methodologies. When she went to Japan, she would buy color pigments for the students and hand them out wrapped in white square pieces of paper. Her liberal attitude and free way of teaching helped her pupils like RYU Minja, LEE Sookja, OH Nangja and LEE Whaja to learn painting outside of the borders of any confining frameworks and truly construct their own art world. CHUN’s attitude as an artist not only inspired her pupils but also many artists shown in this exhibition.</p><p>With her extraordinary sensitivity and sensibility, CHUN transformed, through her own unique artistic language, her childhood memories, inspirations from music, literature and film, romantic love and pain, and maternal love.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike previous exhibitions or research on CHUN Kyung-ja, this exhibition not only highlights CHUN’s contemporary ways of thinking and her influences, but also sheds light on other artists who, although were CHUN’s contemporaries, were inescapably bound to the shackles of Oriental Painting style. However, even as a radical artist at the time, it was not easy for CHUN to break through the patriarchal social framework of her time. She could not even have her own children registered under her own name and family registry, and once, when she had nothing to feed her family and she lost her opportunity to sell her works to a male artist, she began bawling on the spot in front of her child.</p><p>In CHUN’s times, not much different from today, women artists had to fully devote themselves to household chores and childrearing on top of their passions and practices as an artist. They always felt guilty juggling family life and work, and had the compulsion to accomplish everything perfectly. They were always short on time, so their only wish was to paint to their heart’s content. However, just as the war could not destroy art, the hardships of the times and family difficulties did not cool off their passion. Women artists painted in any way they could, continuing to exhibit their works as a group. They broke away from the conservative and standardized “National Art Exhibition” style, and eventually built their own world of art that was closely connected to their lives using their own unique artistic language.</p><p>These women artists are bound in solidarity in the fact that they lived through the same turbulent period, from the Japanese colonial period (1910&ndash;1945), to the National Liberation of Korea (1945), Korean War (1950&ndash;1953), April 19 Revolution (1960), 12/12 Coup D'etat (1960), May 16 Military Coup (1961), Military Dictatorship (1961&ndash;1979), 10.26 Incident (1979), Gwangju Uprising (1980), New Military Regime (1980&ndash;1993), and the democratization movements that continued since the establishment of the government of the Republic of Korea. As society, individual life, and art can never stand separate, this exhibition sought to connect the political and social movements with artistic trends from the Japanese colonial period to the 1990s, and find their connections to refocus on the Oriental Painting world at large. This exhibition systematically organizes, through an objective perspective, the myriad materials and resources related to educational institutions during the Japanese colonial period, the development of <em>Joseon Art Exhibition</em>, educational institutions after liberation, the growth of <em>National Art Exhibition</em> and political and social interventions, the progress of Oriental Painting, and group activities and achievements. By organizing in detail and comparing each artist's chronology, <em>Turbulent Times: Women, Life, Art</em> offers an accurate understanding of the featured women artists’ works, and examines how they have grown from the collective “female Oriental Painting artists” employing similar materials and methods, to “artists” they are today.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2024%2F&FILE_NM=20240801152804_5b0a93aceab24e63b2d99b8d6b59f5eb_fe0ff165dd98477fbf26653c0e4cd3bc,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1309905,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Non-humans in various forms, for instance, machinery, animals, vegetation, and ideas, have been regarded as actors equal to humans, and social phenomena have been described as the relationships among these actors. Historian Dipesh Chakrabarty argues that “the globe” is an anthropocentric construct and suggests that “the planet” be understood as an alternative concept to “the world,” “the Earth,” and “the globe” in terms of reflecting on the place inhabited by humans and non-humans from a planetary perspective. According to Chakrabarty, whereas “the global” refers to issues occurring within the context of human time, “the planetary” de-centralizes the human to reveal vast processes on a non-human level. His planetary thinking does not place humans above other life forms and serves as a warning about the dangers of anthropocentrism, allowing for a view of all things on the planet as equal.</p><p><br></p><p>The SeMA Omnibus is a large-scale collection exhibition presented at the main branch and three branch museums of the Seoul Museum of Art, in keeping with the museum’s 2024 institutional agenda, “connection.” <em>Planet Nine,&nbsp;</em>held at the Nam-Seoul Museum of Art, explores questions generated by non-human actors, animate or inanimate, through the museum collection and reflects on the contemporary situation in which everything is hyperconnected and the interactions and relationships between humans and non-humans have come to the fore. Further, the exhibition envisions a planet on which humans are no longer central but, rather, coexist with disparate beings equally and without hierarchy.</p><p><br></p><p>The title of the exhibition, <em>Planet Nine</em>, refers to the ninth planet presumed to exist beyond the eight planets already identified in the solar system, thus representing uncharted terrain as well as the great potential apart from the planets defined and named by humans. The works on display depict the connections between humans and various non-humans, including machines, robots, nature, daily objects, and invisible viruses, and they call for a reconsideration of the meaning of values and beings that have long been neglected. These works disturb the systems and institutions designed for the comfort and prosperity of human life and the categories constructed based on human perspectives. As Chakrabarty’s statement that “The age of the global as such is ending” suggests, the planetary perspective invites contemplation in a dimension distinct from the current one by taking a step away from human prospects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><span style='color: rgb(0, 168, 133);'>PART 1.

The exhibition highlights the point that non-places confront with the traditional place of social interchange, in accordance with the anthropologist Marc Auge. The artist captures the mixed mobility of modern people moving in a coordinated manner in the typical non-place, the airport, and connects this to the contrasting images of the 'Hydra,' with its tentacle-like extensions, and the 'Square,' symbolizing a wide horizontal plaza. The artist considers the mixed, ambiguous senses, which can be encountered only at the non-places through the two conflicting and contradictory images, similar to the senses modern people are having and represents as the temporary, mixed space existing in the same age.</p><p><br></p><p>■ Wonhae Hwang</p><p>Wonhae Hwang has been working on redistributing the embodied senses and mobility experienced in urban spaces by finding similarities with the geometric elements and patterns of architecture, and reconfiguring them into planes and installations within space.

The theme of the exhibition, angels, is a religious symbol that connects God and humans. More than that, however, angels serve as symbolic beings that have become a natural part of our perception. Visualizing the image of angels as those that lie somewhere between what exists and what is absent,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the artist first became interested in angels when she came across a fragrance called “Angel.”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In this exhibition, Shin highlights the meaning of angels, something that everyone knows of yet has never seen.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Her angel is a being in the realm of illusion, hovering between heaven and earth, life and death, body and soul, and is presented metaphorically through the material properties of soap. The artist has used soap as a material for her sculptures for more than 30 years. For Shin, soap also has a materiality to it that wavers between transparency and opacity. Still, it is destined to wear down over time, while its scent can only be experienced by those who have come in contact with it in person. These characteristics of soap are connected to the symbolism of angels, who are intermediate beings between heaven and earth. In particular, the transparency of soap, the light that maximizes its transparency, and its many different scents allow visitors to experience the presence of angels that oscillate between existence and absence.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Visitors can draw closer to contemporary art by appreciating sculptures made from everyday soap, allowing their imagination to run wild through angels, a familiar yet unseen entity.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We hope that this exhibition, which is filled with the light and fragrance of angels that evoke a kind of fantasy across generations, will inspire you to rediscover the very same angels you have always felt are familiar.&nbsp;</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2024%2F&FILE_NM=20240529191622_49d7ebff677545d9a297e79c18d134bd_e5c4d584b1ca40bd9fff0a6873eeabed,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1293655,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

His particular focus has been the changes happening in urban space as a result of redevelopment. Among his subjects of continuous long-term observation are certain urban spaces of Seoul that constitute an important part of his work, typical examples being the Bulgwang-dong neighborhood and the Eunpyeong New Town redevelopment zone in Eunpyeog-gu. Kang wandered around these areas for more than 20 years, documenting the redevelopment process, upon which he based the production of his works. His representative series?Mickey’s House, Trainee, The House and Vanish Away - A Record of Eunpyeong New Town?were all created around the redevelopment process in these areas.<br><br>The aim of the exhibition is to interpret Kang’s entire body of work and materials as “Kang Hong-Goo’s Seoul Archive,” with the Art Archives, Seoul Museum of Art’s collection of Kang’s materials at the core. The artist’s photographic images documenting Seoul are significant as the primary subject matter for his main works, but there is much more. To Kang, Seoul is not just a city, but a pronoun for all cities. Seoul was the window that opened a new horizon for him to observe and explore the social phenomenon called “reorganization of urban space,” and his exploration of that urban space gradually moved beyond Seoul as a foothold, expanding to the Gyeonggi-do area, Busan and Cheongju. In other words, Kang Hong-Goo’s documents related to Seoul have been a central matrix for his work.<br><br>Seoul is at the same time a single city and many cities. There are many different Seouls, yet they are still the same city. Though the Seoul captured by Kang’s photography is one that no longer exists, his images of the city can be seen anywhere today. It is the Seoul witnessed by the artist, and the Seoul that is rather familiar to us as well. Thus “Kang Hong-Goo’s Seoul Archive” leaves plenty of room for interpretation, going beyond the dimension of one individual’s archive accumulated for work. When we temporarily put aside aesthetic issues, we encounter a body of intriguing material that can be explored not just within the boundaries of art, but also in collaboration with diverse disciplines including the humanities, social sciences, urban studies and architecture, with regard to the transformation of Seoul and its spaces, the consequent changes in people’s lives, issues of change and preservation, and memory and documentation. During the exhibition period there will be lectures and talks by researchers and artists of various disciplines who propose a “thick reading” of Kang Hong-Goo’s works and documents, as a way to experiment with and practice the different possibilities offered by Kang Hong-Goo’s Seoul Archive. It is our hope that this exhibition will serve as an opportunity to take a deeper look at Seoul, and moreover, to consider how its development affects the conditions of our lives.<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2024%2F&FILE_NM=20240425091530_4a2b9993170749478648cbd84851e68d_422de0c141c3492e9555572e444be69d,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1283621,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The largest of its kind in Asia, this exhibition offers a comprehensive overview of the illustrious career of Foster and the activities of Foster + Partners, the practice he founded in 1967. Based in the United Kingdom, Foster + Partners boasts a global presence. Of the over 500 projects led by the practice, from the 1960s to the present, FUTURE POSITIVE pays particular attention to the studio’s significant contributions to public spaces for culture and the arts. Notably, the exhibition highlights Foster and the practice’s forward-thinking ethos, tracing their early commitment to sustainability and visionary outlook for the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Born in 1935 in Manchester, United Kingdom, Norman Foster studied architecture and urban planning at the University of Manchester before earning his master’s degree from the Yale School of Architecture. It was at Yale where he crossed paths with fellow British architect Richard Rogers. With sisters Wendy Cheesman and Georgie Wolton, they established Team 4 in 1962. Together, they embarked on pioneering projects that leveraged the cutting-edge technologies of the era, including the Reliance Controls project of 1967. Transitioning from Team 4 after a four-year tenure, Foster and Cheesman &ndash; now married &ndash; co-founded Foster Associates, laying the foundation for what would eventually become Foster + Partners. Today, the firm stands as a global architectural powerhouse with a headcount of over 2,000 individuals. Incorporating dozens of specialized in-house teams across the genres of architecture, urban design, engineering, industrial design, interior design, urban and landscape design, and research and development, Foster + Partners has reshaped urban landscapes and redefined contemporary living through transformative projects like the Great Court of the British Museum, the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Headquarters in Hongkong, Apple Park in the United States, and London Stansted Airport.</p><p><br></p><p>While Norman Foster is widely renowned as a trailblazer of innovative and technology-focused architecture, known for drawing upon advanced engineering and computer technology, this exhibition focuses on his and Foster + Partners’ commitment to sustainability as a fundamental philosophy underpinning the practice. Since the 1960s, Foster’s work has extended beyond technological innovation to designing environmental masterplans and carbon-neutral cities, and exploring the utility and user experience of living environments. This practice, along with future-facing visions for new modes of building and living, profoundly influences his approach to his most widely-known and large-scale projects. FUTURE POSITIVE, conceived as part of Seoul Museum of Art’s 2024 agenda on architecture, offers a wider examination of the experiments by Norman Foster and Foster + Partners. By bridging past achievements with contemporary aspirations, it aims to inspire new thinking and imaginings of the coming future.<br></p><p><br></p><p>FUTURE POSITIVE is structured into five sections: Introduction to Sustainability, Culture + Retrofit, Wellbeing + Technology, Public + Placemaking, and Future. It features an array of over 300 artifacts from 50 significant projects, ranging from architectural models to drawings, videos, and archives. Norman Foster and Foster + Partners remain ever optimistic and enthusiastic about the future because they work to seamlessly integrate forward-looking research findings into present day practice, thereby establishing a virtuous loop and nestling the built environment in harmonious coexistence with its surroundings. This pursuit of sustainability amid temporal and physical transformations reflects an idealistic philosophy informed by meticulous analysis and research. Above all, their narrative of change is distinguished by their uncompromising emphasis on the needs of people and planet.<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2024%2F&FILE_NM=20240418021703_d5ed6384af0740ac8cddbf20e9e02a4f_fbe2557d7a484276b7710435c1417fd3,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1280509,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

In 1999, the two acquired the rights to an undisclosed background character inexpensively from a Japanese manga design agency. They named the imaginary character, Annlee, and began to fill her life stories. For the next three years, about 20 artists participated in this project, giving birth to over 30 multimedia works in the form of paintings, sculptures, videos, posters, books, and music. These works came to be put together in the exhibition titled <em>No Ghost Just a Shell</em> in 2002. It is both a collection of individual works, and a multiauthor project around a single character. The title originated from <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, the 1995 Japanese animation that raises a question as to whether there is human consciousness, soul, or ghost, in the cyborg, i.e., inside the shell of a cybernetic body.</p><p><br>Afterwards Huyghe and Parreno transferred her copyright to the character itself by founding an association in her name; and in December 2002, they decided to liberate Annlee from the realm of representation and staged a display of fireworks above Miami Beach in Art Basel, through which they declared Annlee vanished for good. Annlee was emancipated and sentenced to death at once, but <em>No Ghost Just a Shell</em> in its entirety became a collection of Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. This acquisition was ground-breaking in terms of revisiting the relationships of ideas, mediums, forms and rights in art. 20 years or so after its inception, the historic project has now grown all the more in importance in 2024. This exhibition made up of the works from Van Abbemuseum will present interesting but critical perspectives on today’s postdigital era where technological environments like generative Artificial Intelligence are significantly changing the ways art is produced, and are prompting digital images that exist as data to evolve on their own as subjects having emotions, personality, and identity.</p><p><br></p><p>* Richard Philips, <em>Annlee</em>, 2002, oil on canvas, 198.6×249.6×3.9cm.

A key part of the initiative is to open the exhibition titled <em>Architecture, Space Time Scenarios</em>, which offers a contemplative examination of architecture with an emphasis on the concept of “time.”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We at SeMA have been led to reflect on the life cycle of architecture amidst the ongoing remodeling of not only the SeMA but also other prestigious museums at home and abroad, along with the redevelopment and reconstruction projects transforming urban landscapes. In the fields of law, public administration, and economics, which exert a direct influence on the processes of constructing, utilizing, and dismantling buildings, the categorization of a building’s life cycle typically revolves around considerations of safety, cost, and environmental impact. Nonetheless, should we conceptualize architecture as an entity that evolves through a myriad of relationships and experiences, akin to human existence, its vigor cannot solely be assessed through tangible phases such as “new construction.” It is because architecture is intricately intertwined with human life, and the vibrancy of architectural forms varies in pace and dimension, influenced by the intensity of its interactions.</p><p><br></p><p>Architecture constitutes a foundational aspect of human existence, intimately engaging with our physical selves and constructing layers of narratives encompassing experience, memory, and history. Such narratives, interweaving human actions within the dimensions of space and time, render architecture a fascinating subject through which to examine the tapestry of life. Public art museums, accessible to a broad and indeterminate audience, represent a distinct architectural category with a rich historical lineage, embodying a multitude of stories accumulated over time. The Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA), as a public art museum, finds itself at a critical juncture of architectural emergence and transformation. It faces the imperative to accommodate an increasingly varied audience, to foster engagement, to facilitate shared experiences, and to maintain its dynamism and relevance.</p><p><br></p><p>The initial phase involves comprehending the multifaceted narratives that emerge from the interplay among the diverse components constituting the museum: visitors, artworks, institutional frameworks, and programs. This is predicated on the understanding that narratives spanning extensive temporal ranges link the past and present to the impending future. It is imperative to meticulously examine historical contexts and then envision the future for the community, concurrently reimagining and shaping the museum in the contemporary moment. <em>Architecture, Space Time Scenarios</em> will explore architecture through the lens of time, highlighting the dynamic essence of architecture enriched by its deep temporal layers.

The estimated duration for the exhibition is less than 1 hour.  - In the Archive Room of this exhibition, there is a section titled “Touchable Sculptures” that showcases tactile tools. Tactile tools are not solely intended for visually impaired visitors; rather, they invite a hands-on exploration of Chung’s new creations by a diverse audience, including adults, teenagers, and children. The objective is to encourage visitors to actively interact with and interpret the artworks and the exhibition as a whole through a multi-sensory experience. - We encourage you to explore on the public programs (writing workshop, drawing workshop, etc.) curated in conjunction with the exhibition, aligning with the theme of 'amassed time.' - We partnered with the brand ODUJEJ to produce Muddle Crayons, mirroring the artist's journaling-like drawing approach that draws from vivid memories and emotions. You can find these crayons, resembling some of the new works featured in the exhibition, at the art bookstore The Reference (www.the-ref.kr) on the museum's 3rd floor.","<p><strong>？<em>？</em>？？？<em>？</em>“I think I wanted to express thoughts that go inward, not thoughts that go outward or make a sound. I believed that it’s when problems amass and lump inside that they can be expressed artistically.”</strong></p><p><em><br></em></p><p><em>Mass</em> is a solo exhibition of Chung Hyun, an artist who has explored the properties and possibilities of discarded materials such as debris, waste, and scrap metal to create figures with bold gesture. The exhibition is a comprehensive introduction to his sculpture, printmaking, drawing, and archives along with the sculptural practice from the 1990s to the present. The title of the exhibition, Mass, implies the artist's approach of maximizing the medium's properties with minimal intervention and highlights the sculptural characteristics evident in his works. It also signifies the “amassed time” endured by Chung's materials, highlighting their unique existence. Focusing on the seemingly insignificant or discarded materials that bear the weight of experiences, the exhibition ultimately aims to survey Chung Hyun’s distinctive art world where the sculpting of non-sculptural materials takes place.</p><p><br></p><p>In the realm of contemporary sculpture in Korea, Chung occupies a distinctive position. Noteworthy is his consistent focus on human figures?somewhat divergent from the prevailing wave of abstract expression in Korean art during the 1980s?as well as his interest in sculpting objects not commonly associated with the medium. Embarking on earnest artistic endeavors in the late 1980s, Chung delved into the study of anatomy to critically examine the human body. He considered it the fundamental subject of art, a study of which led him to a contemplation of the existential aspect of human life. During this period, Chung's skeletal representations of the human body were mainly crafted using plaster and manila hemp. As Chung advanced through the 1990s and 2000s, each of his works showcased in various exhibitions employed diverse materials, yet they all shared the inherent quality of uselessness. Renowned for his The Standing Man, for which he used old wooden railway sleepers, Chung continued to use materials awaiting disposal, such as shattered glass, petroleum residue (coal tar), scrap iron, and ascon (asphalt-concrete) and assigned distinct roles to them. These lumps, precariously held together and seemingly on the verge of coming apart, prompt us to think about the existence buried within these amassed forms.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This exhibition focuses on investigating Chung's distinctive identity and experimental nature, diverging from the more familiar aspects of his work focused on human figures. The spotlight is on the unique grammar Chung employs in selecting and examining the subjects of his sculptures. Adopting a non-realist approach, Chung emphasizes narratives that emerge from the properties and characteristics of materials when his intervention is minimized. The objective is not to assert self-expression but to underscore the temporality, memory, and history inherent in materials as unique entities. The exhibition, starting in the outdoor garden of Nam-Seoul Museum of Art and extending to the second-floor gallery, encompasses major works from the 1980s and 1990s, as well as drawings, archives, and new works. In this solo exhibition, particular attention is given to the artist's perspective on drawings: for Chung, drawings hold the same status as sculptures, surpassing the role of mere sketches. In keeping with this perspective, the exhibition is organized to display his sculptures and drawings in harmony.</p><p><br></p><p>In preparation for this exhibition?where his recent works are featured? Chung strived to discard his longstanding sculptural habits and established ideas. Even while integrating materials such as timber weathered by time, wood charred black by forest fires, and tons of shredded materials into becoming artworks, Chung has assumed the role of an observer rather than a creator for years. More than 30 years later, Chung remains a steadfast observer, still aspiring to 'wander well.' The reflections of this seasoned observer?directed towards the 'uncommonness of trivial things'?are profoundly interwoven into this exhibition.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2023%2F&FILE_NM=20231127192949_a46eb31a20c649ce8d08e88a0124f3cc_0c325bb90c1e40dd8429f71721292235,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1249732,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Koo stirred a sensation in the Korean photography and art world with his new concept and form of “making photo” in works presented in <em>The New Wave of Photography</em> (Walker Hill Art Center, Seoul, May 18&ndash;June 17), an exhibition he organized as a curator and showed as one of the artists. The idea of photography taking off from its traditional role of recording or documenting, to becoming an art form charged with subjective expressions that reflect attributes of various mediums like painting, sculpture and print, penetrates Koo’s entire oeuvre, and opened new territories in Korean contemporary photography.</p><p><br></p><p>Koo’s retrospective begins with the section Cabinet, which consists of works and materials that have rarely been shown to the public up to now, such as some of the objects the artist has collected since his childhood as a sensitive and introverted boy until the present, as well as photographs of such objects. The section also displays photographs including his very first <em>Self-Portrait</em> (1968) taken when the artist was in middle school, and his studies and copies of master paintings from his university years. Organized according to the chronologically changing themes of the works, the exhibition with sections The Journey of Adventure, One World, and Temple of Spirit, displays over 500 works and 600 resource materials from 43 series chosen out of a total of over 50 series of the artist’s works, from <em>My Early Europe</em> (1979&ndash;1985) which the artist produced as an overseas student abroad in 1979, to the recent <em>Incognito</em> series (1996&ndash;ongoing). <em>In the Beginning</em> (1991&ndash;2004) and <em>Goodbye Paradise</em> (1993) left a lasting impression in the audience in the 2001 exhibition <em>Koo Bohnchang</em> (Samsung Rodin Gallery, Seoul, May 4 &ndash;June 24), and <em>Vessel</em> series (2004&ndash;ongoing) introduced in his 2006 exhibition <em>Bohnchang Koo</em> (Kukje Gallery, Seoul, July 7&ndash;30) drew both local and global attention on Joseon White Porcelain. However, such major series are only the tip of the iceberg of Koo’s deep, extensive oeuvre. This exhibition brings to the audience Koo’s works in a wide variety of materials and forms, from snapshots of urban landscapes, to variations of Koo himself as the subject, abstract representations of nature, and works that delicately capture the layers of time of old objects. Of special note, the exhibition features some of Koo’s series <em>Untitled</em> (1989), which is rendered in solarization technique that demonstrates the artist’s unique surrealistic sense of aesthetics, and had only been partly shown once in a group exhibition in 1989. The exhibition also presents the <em>Concrete Gwanghwamun</em> series (2010) for the first time, centering on Gwanghwamun as a site of turbulent history, from the Imjin War, to the Japanese Colonial period, the Korean War, and the era of military dictatorship. With presentation of related materials and text faithful to the works, in addition to the works themselves, Koo’s retrospective attempts to truly and fully reveal the artist’s life-time of hard work and efforts deeply-ingrained in each of his refined photographs, and expose the true gem-like qualities of his work with the universal narratives they express. The exhibition also introduces a detailed and systematic chronological timeline shedding light on the artist’s early years, the types of art works produced by the era, the relationships between domestic and overseas influences and their impact on each other, and Koo’s accounts of organizing and showing in exhibitions. The timeline provides a detailed look into the relationship between Koo and Korean contemporary photography, and how the two affected each other to develop and expand internationally. This all became possible thanks to the artist’s passionate habit of collecting, preserving and cherishing works and materials from exhibitions he has organized or shown for a long time.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, forty-five years since Koo stroke up the courage to embark on a long voyage in search of his own path, his works are in the collections of leading art institutions in Korea and across the world, and his exhibitions are being held continuously. This is the dazzling outcome of Koo’s arduous but pleasant journey of searching for his work in omnidirectional ways around the world, and for persevering for years to come across his desired subjects. Koo has made immense contributions to the globalization of Korean photography through exhibitions in the country and abroad as both artist and curator representing Korea. He made full efforts to promote the works of his contemporaries as well as artists of generations that came before and after him without any sense of elitism, and has expanded photography as a genre of contemporary art through experimental works that were always ahead of his time. Therefore, through this profoundly significant retrospective, I hope that Koo’s Voyages take us on a meditative journey to reflect on the meaning of our very own existence and life.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2023%2F&FILE_NM=20231113160347_c75a5017e8ad4c7cb59f6ed21a3a8799_f2fab4ffcd444b0db5a1d78b44ade80e,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1244533,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Seeing an exhibition, visiting an art museum?what does this mean to you? I am aware that each of you may have your different reasons for visiting the museum. It’s worth noting, however, that artists and curators produce their artworks and exhibitions with the intention of initiating a dialogue with you. The dialogue, the act of sharing words and thoughts, is particularly important to this exhibition. For this reason, I begin the exhibition with this very intention of speaking to you, of offering you words.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><br></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><em>The Part In The Story Where Our Accumulating Dust Becomes A Mountain</em> is an exhibition that considers the role of contemporary art museums within the context of ‘sharing’, the 2023 institutional agenda of Seoul Museum of Art. Traditionally, art museums have functioned as spaces for collecting, researching and exhibiting artworks. Today, however, museums are transforming into social spaces that build shared experience and collective values through engagement with diverse clusters of people. The ideas towards the relationship such as ‘mutuality’ and ‘interconnectedness’ become important values for museum activities. Sharing, which involves distributing what one owns, necessitates the presence of others. It is in this sense that sharing becomes a value that helps us reconsider the practice of contemporary art museums that place ‘relationships’ at its core. What, then, do we share in the museum, and with whom?&nbsp;</span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><br></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><em>The Part In The Story Where Our Accumulating Dust Becomes A Mountain</em> brings collections?the museum’s representative public resources? to the centre of sharing. It is a place for us to encounter and speak with each other, holding as its starting point the collections of three institutions: Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA), Singapore Art Museum (SAM) and the Queensland Art Gallery | Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA). Sharing, as practised by the art museum, is a journey to find common ground amidst misunderstandings, differences and surprises within unexpected encounters, thereby reconfiguring our own respective bounds of knowledge along the way. As such, the artworks in this exhibition go beyond objects of appreciation and instead become tools and catalysts that connect and intertwine our varying ways of life, creating a new practice of sharing.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><br></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'>This exhibition utilises action-words to imagine the movements that must take precedence when we attempt to practise sharing in the art museum, and more broadly, within life. The work of facing someone beyond my comfort zone (love-ing), the will to understand the language of an other (translate-ing), the process of discovering and forming a relationship with meanings beyond language (abstract-ing and silence-ing), the movements to build collective experiences and senses (statue-ing), the practice of connecting such movements in various directions (island-ing) and the attempt to thereby create new shapes (webbed-ing)?all of these unfold within a network of specific situations, movements and artworks. You may follow this chain of practice among the artworks or re-examine the meaning of sharing as you reconstruct your own relational network. Through these artworks, we encounter novel situations and share conversations, deliberating on and devising movements of common practice.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><br></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'>Only when we meet, we can truly learn how to share with one another and what we can produce together. <em>The Part In the Story Where Our Accumulating Dust Becomes A Mountain</em> proposes various situations and gatherings, through which I hope to build the meaning of ‘sharing’ together with you. This exhibition, therefore, takes time and relies on your continued participation. Slowly following the forms of practises each driven by the artworks, I hope you can reflect on what can be shared and collaboratively produced within the art museum, and to contemplate the significance of this exhibition itself, which embodies the very essence of sharing.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><br></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'>With participating artist Amanda Heng’s work title, I will end this letter here for now.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><br></span></p><p dir='ltr'><em><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'>Let’s Chat!</span></em></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2023%2F&FILE_NM=20231127131036_c6dc0676bc764656b7545c742cb8d30c_fe4d88a1b202429a8304f4ff33149c82,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1249276,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Korean pop artists have been exploring form, the unconscious, and social phenomena in the mass media with serious experimentation and a witty attitude, freely incorporating references to art history between the dominant currents of Realism and Abstraction in the Korean art scene. The exhibition also looks back at the works of Dongi Lee, who has been experimenting with mass media images as one of the topical issues in contemporary art since his early career, and Sangwoo Kang, who represents the opposite side of that experimentation.

Held at the Nam-Seoul Museum of Art, the 2020 Seo-Seoul Museum of Art pre-opening public program “Someday Everyday Everybody” questioned whether or not an art museum that, going beyond space and time limited in reality, created experiences and knowledge through multiple voices was possible. The 2021 Seo-Seoul Museum of Art pre-opening public program “Signaling Perimeters” examined the relationship between the arts and society under the topics of the local community and the media. The 2022 Seo-Seoul Museum of Art pre-opening public program “Exceptional Times, Uncertain Moves” sought to gauge whether contemporary art and art museums could redesign new forms of cultural production and perspectives for experiencing and thinking about them in a dramatically changing environment.

In addition, besides discussing experimentation with and expansion of technological changes, formal variations, and aesthetic experiences appearing in the current of evolving from media in an analog environment to those in a digital environment, we will discuss contemporary artistic discourses including ethicality and visuality, self-theorization as a trend in feminism, and queer temporality in experimental cinema.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>“The Arts and Education” will ask questions such as “What are the roles of the arts for new ideas?” and “What kinds of knowledge are necessary for next generations to shape the future?” and reexamine activities and experiences of diverse layers regarding the learning that the Seo-Seoul Museum of Art has shared from 2000 to 2023 in collaboration with adolescents, educators, experience designers, and artists. In this process, we will ask again whether it is possible actively to captivate and form solidarity with adolescents as active actors in art museums and search for the direction in which the museum’s education must proceed in the future. In addition, we will examine the various theoretical research and praxis of artists, designers, educators, and curators aiming at educational values at the intersection of the arts and education and continue to explore topics including the contribution of the arts to public education, the educational potentials of artworks, and the participation of the community in contemporary art on the basis of learning.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>The intermedia lab at the Seo-Seoul Museum of Art will be planned as an analogue and digital platform through which discussions on trans-locality and community and digital culture and media with people from diverse fields can be expanded while the complexity of cities can be interpreted, and new artworks can be created.

In particular, the COVD-19 pandemic, by revealing social, economic, racial, and geographical inequality and hence visualizing the interrelationship among ecological crisis, development model, and human health, has served as an occasion for discussing and activating the urgency of a shift to an ecological society. Faced with environmental changes on the level of world history such as climate crisis and increased migration, we will conduct research on the interrelationship between climate and the media and the intersection of culture, humanities, science, politics, and ecology and explore the imagination and praxis of &nbsp;artists, architects, designers, researchers, educators, curators and activists.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>LJ SUNGMIN<br>Curator, Museum Division, Culture Headquarters, Seoul Metropolitan Government</p><p dir='ltr'>Hosted by Seoul Metropolitan Government Culture Headquarters, Seoul Museum of Art</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2023%2F&FILE_NM=20231101182908_6c46adf8524745ef8deeeb1edd3a00aa_44a169f866354ab38a87d969be6eb58e,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1242669,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The exhibition is filled with all sorts of <em>materials</em> surrounding us, the<em> shapes</em> that become vessels for those materials, and the<em> touch</em> of the artist who cuts and pastes the materials to create these shapes.<br><br>Artist Eunu Lee starts her day by going to her workshop. She sets her timer for an hour to draw. For Lee, drawing is like a repetitive habit of life in which she draws whatever comes to her, with no particular goal in mind. As she draws lines that connect one dot to another, various shapes connect and begin stacking up, creating interesting shapes in the process. She then transfers her work to graph paper, and subsequently adds texture and color to match each shape.<br><br>The entire space of the Children’s Gallery was designed using a grid of squares. For the artist, the grid is an important tool for quantifying the size of objects and the communicative language underlying drawing, which has become a regular part of Eunu Lee’s daily routine and something she visualizes in diverse ways throughout an exhibition space that is standardized by a grid. The lines and shapes in the drawings can rise off the paper and become sculptural, or they can be magnified into architectural units and physically penetrate their structures.<br><br>The sculptures, large and small, that dot the exhibition venue are made from a variety of materials from the world around us. The artist has imbued them with their own characters and expressions by cutting and shaping them after long hours of manual labor, and by pairing them with everyday objects that had different uses originally. Part furniture, part toy, the sculptures remind people of their favorite objects.<br><br>What does it mean to<em> just</em> do something without a specific purpose? <em>The Shape of Touch</em> is the result of many hours of simple, repetitive drawing and creating.

It creates a new landscape by becoming an independent world or an ecosystem. The etymology of the word “garden” refers to “enclosure surrounded by walls and fences.” Mainly built by a meticulous composition and combination of natural and artificial materials, the garden as an exquisite amalgamation of nature and culture reflects the long-standing human desires for aesthetics and delightful indulgence in nature. <em>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon</em> explores the garden as the artists’ reaction to nature and the world around us, and the way the artists grant the garden their own symbolic meaning. The exhibited works explore issues of reality and fiction, or simulacrum and reproduction, and attempt at methodological experiments that observe and represent the various ecosystems around us today in diverse ways. They also use nature as the motif to metaphorically reveal the psychological state derived from an individual's identity, or build a media ecosystem that interacts with the audience.

The artist’s glittery but black sculptures charged with both scars and beauty exhibit the double-sidedness of life and reflect the inner world of the artist. <u><strong>Hyun Nahm</strong></u>’s work begins with the artist’s interest in the concept of “Chukgyeong” (miniascape), the art of miniaturizing vast landscapes of nature. The artist fully engages with the unique properties of industrial materials that are widely used today, and tries to capture the present landscape through such use of materials as opposed to reproducing his subject. <u><strong>Kim Joon</strong></u> researches certain areas in Korea and abroad, archiving sounds of different times and spaces. His works are a collection and reconstitution of the rocks and plants found in the natural environment of such regions. The artist reproduces, assembles, and positions parts of nature in various ways, and the audience experiences the work synesthetically by directly shaking the speakers. Inspired mainly by natural phenomena, <u><strong>Kohui</strong>&nbsp;</u>explores relationships linked to sound and builds an aural ecosystem through interactions with the audience.

There are questions as to whether it actually existed, but the lush, tree-filled garden, created by drawing water to a high ground with the architectural technology of the time in a region where it hardly rains, is considered one of the most miraculous manmade architectural works of all times. The hanging garden was the representative outcome and product of human desires to create a green mountain-like landscape that is almost impossible on dry land. While desires for nature take a different form today from that of the past, the aspirations to build an almost impossible world have long remained a driving force in art.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p>In the modern society, the garden extends to the concept of common land such as public gardens or even parks, and exemplifies an open space and site of sharing and enjoyment for the public. In the process of modernization, parks for communities began to be designed, and the private garden?a physical and spiritual space that enhances the quality of human life?also began to be transformed into public parks. The Nam-Seoul Museum of Art, which was built as the Belgian Consulate for diplomatic purposes in the early 1900s, has been used as an art museum since 2004, reinvented into a space where the public can collectively appreciate and enjoy the architecture of the museum and the exhibited artworks. In this space that permeates the everyday life of the public, <em>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon</em> welcomes the audience through various senses including sight, sound, touch, and smell through the exhibition and related programs.

The exhibition focuses on the artist's later works, which contain ecological concepts and messages about civilization, the environment, and life that he has been unfolding since the 2000s. It also examines the major artistic philosophies explored by Kim as he generated these works. Since the very beginning of his career, Kim has been engaged with the art and society of his time. He has challenged the authority of both the artist and art and cast a critical eye on official institutions and accepted society through the concept of art as self-reflection, editing, and dialogue. In this process, Kim’s work has gradually expanded beyond the exploration of art to the level of society and even all humanity, conveying messages that are close to our lives.</p><p><br></p><p>The Kim Yong-Ik Archive, which is comprised of materials that he produced and collected throughout his life, is a multilateral space that shows the development of his thoughts. It demonstrates the formation of the ideas underlying his works rather than the process of their creation, and in a sense his archival pieces function as independent stand-alone works. Like his writing, which he has been pursuing for more than fifty years, documentation has become a way of life for him, demonstrating how his art is a product of continuous interaction with the art and society of his time.</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition uses his archive to trace the evolution of the ideas underlying the artist’s works, from his early epistemological aesthetics to his later ontological philosophy. Kim Yong-Ik’s art-making has evolved from early works exploring visual perception, conceptualism, and modernist theories through art to his later works exploring the ontological aspects of art, humans, and civilization. Over this process, the artist has integrated art-making into his way of life and philosophy. The title of the exhibition, <em>To the Last Generation</em>, is a metaphor for this journey in his life and work. He has been engaging in dialogue with less-accepted ideas, tabooed behaviors, and marginalized people considered taboo by society as he sought new possibilities in them. It is hoped that Kim Yong-Ik’s journey will contribute to helping us think about alternatives for our lives and society in this twenty-first century as we face a pandemic and the climate crisis.</p><p><br></p><p>Photo: <em>Kim&nbsp;Yong-Ik Monologue: In Search of a Shadow</em>, 2023 (still) ⓒ Taehoon Kwon<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2023%2F&FILE_NM=20230822203959_970dd490a0a44f8ebe93c5d9d4e4432d_3e0d721a0a2f4494a7af76359b820b3a,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1210481,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Along the inclined path is a terraced rooftop garden formed out of cubes. In comparison with the geometric arrangement of this space, the rooftop garden sections on the second, third, and fourth floors offer works of art that adopt unique interpretations on the traditional form of production of sculpture. The starting point for this project is <em>Untitled</em> by artist Chung Hyun, who forgoes the creation of new shapes in favor of repurposing materials that have let go of their original function over the years. Up the stairs are <em>Sailor&nbsp;</em>by Chung Soyoung which visualizes discontinuous trajectory of time by folding and unfolding aluminum panel, and, <em>De-veloping-Silhouette Casting</em> by Hong MyungSeop, who has created a “de-veloping” strategy of erecting shapes cut own out two-dimensional surfaces, dissolving the traditional sculptural strategy of a casting or “enveloping” the form to fill in. In the rooftop garden on the fourth floor, new experiments in sculpting to create three-dimensional shapes are illustrated by Kim In-kyum’s <em>Emptiness</em> and Hong Suk-ho’s <em>An Iron Plate Fold</em>. In the former, the artist creates a three-dimensional sculpture that can be seen as a flat surace at a certain point of view; the latter has the surfaces of iron plates folded to show a new space where each surface meets.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Across from the Collaborating Space are the Learning Space and Exchanging Space, which connect art archives with learning and participation. In these two spaces, visitors can view artworks that raise questions about the ordinary scenes and experience we encounter every day but all too easily pass by. On the first floor of the Learning Space, visitors can imagine the small stories of things around them through Hwang Hae-sun’s <em>The Balloons</em>, which captures the scene when one clutches an armful of balloons. In <span dir='ltr' lang='EN-US'>Gimhongsok</span>’s <em>Stairs Construction&ndash;Podium</em>, the subjects of the work are commonplace cardboard boxes that have been cast in bronze. It poses questions about the symbolism associated with the artwork’s materials, as well as the public service role symbolized by the precariously stacked boxes and the microphone podium. On the first floor of the Exchanging Space, Koh San-keum’s <em>Baettaragi(Novel by Dong-in Kim)</em> converts the texts of a scene from Dong-in Kim’s novel “Baettaragi” into strings of beads. In transposing the characters into beads, the artist offers a new perspective on the daily experience of reading texts.</p><p>The Art Archives’ architecture has a sprawling layout comprising different sites and pathways, as well as a layered vertical structure. SeMA-Project A encourages visitors to rediscover the artworks resituated in new environments, facilitating diverse perspectives as they roam through the Arts Archive spaces with their spreading and gathering arrangement.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2023%2F&FILE_NM=20230309095357_98f742ad6da64a188c3821cef13b1469_d9a3568ca55d473dbfe7fbc242389a5f,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1123607,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

In <em>Fan</em> (2020), Tala Madani sharply exposes the constant feed of unreliable information and our utter dependence on it: “What we need,” says Madani, “is not a softening of reality through beauty, not a morphine for our pain through art, but ideas for shifts in consciousness.”</p><p><br></p><p>Even though the art we need at this point is cute and familiar, slick and unobjectionable, it has to be capable of refreshing perceptions left paralyzed, like our senses of smell, during the pandemic.

Jointly curated by SeMA and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, this is the first solo exhibition on Edward Hopper (1882-1967) in Korea. A leading figure in modern art, Hopper captured on canvas the daily lives and sentiments of early 20th-century Americans from a unique perspective. With an artistry transcending time and space, his work has not only greatly influenced fine arts, but culture as a whole, and continues to enjoy worldwide popularity.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2020, <em>The Guardian</em>, a British daily, published an article titled “‘We are all Edward Hopper paintings now:’ is he the artist of the coronavirus age?” Why is Hopper, an American artist from the early 1900s, being reexamined today, at a time when feelings of isolation, disconnection, and alienation are prevalent? As Hopper put it, “Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist.”<a href='#_ftn1' name='_ftnref1' title=''>[1]</a> For him, who was of a taciturn nature, painting was a unique way of expressing his feelings towards the world. The gaze stays on those ordinary things “that others flee from or pass with indifference,”<a href='#_ftn2' name='_ftnref2' title=''>[2]</a> captured through Hopper’s meticulous observation and his unique use of light and shadow, bold composition, and reconstruction of time and space. In this sense, his paintings go beyond the landscape to become an introspective self-portrait and, be it someone’s silhouette across a window, the roof of a low building in contrast with a skyscraper, or a sunset on the railroad, they all resemble us.</p><p><em>Edward Hopper: From City to Coast</em> looks back on the artist’s 65-year painting career, focusing on those places in Paris, New York, northern New England, and Cape Cod whose traces were captured in his works. As he regularly traveled between his longtime home in New York City and various rural and coastal retreats, these places played an integral part in expanding Hopper’s artistic horizons. The exhibition title, which means “On the way” in Korean, is meant to evoke Hopper’s journeys, along which he developed his personal style?each road connecting and becoming a unique trace of his own?and the moments in which we encounter Hopper.&nbsp;</p><p>This exhibition presents 270 pieces spanning Hopper’s entire life, including drawings, prints, oil paintings, watercolors, and materials from the Sanborn Hopper Archive divided into eight sections to provide a faithful overview of the artist’s life and artistic universe. Though Hopper’s work is most often thought of as depicting the solitude of modern people, the paths he walked were diverse and profound. “To me the most important thing is the sense of going on. You know how beautiful things are when you’re traveling.”<a href='#_ftn3' name='_ftnref3' title=''>[3]</a> As his words suggest, Hopper felt a unique sensitivity to place throughout his life, grounded in his keen observational skills and made meaningful through the synthesis of memories and imagination. It is our hope that this exhibition broadens our understanding of Edward Hopper and that, to those of us in many ways fatigued, his works may offer sympathy and solace.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><a href='#_ftnref1' name='_ftn1' title=''>[1]</a> Selected pages from <em>Reality: A Journal of Artists' Opinions</em>, vol. 1, no. 1 (Spring 1953), The Sanborn Hopper Archive at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Frances Mulhall Achilles Library and Archives, New York; gift of the Arthayer R.

His appreciation of art and literature began at an early age. In 1899, he attended the New York School of Illustrating in New York City to study commercial illustration. Then, the following year he enrolled in classes at the New York School of Art, where he pursued his artistic ambitions under the tutelage of some of the forerunners of American realism, including Robert Henri.</p><p>Divided into three periods, this exhibition introduces a selection of works by Hopper including his self-portraits, which were made at different points in his lifetime. The works created during his student days in the early 1900s show his face and upper body. In particular, the numerous drawings of the artist’s hands point to Hopper’s relentless efforts to hone his artistic expression and technical skills through training exercises. The self-portraits highlight his journey of self-reflection as an artist. In one of Hopper’s charcoal drawings from the mid-1920s, two emblematic items appear?his hat and the etching press that he acquired in 1916?revealing both his personal and professional means of self-representation. During the 1940s, when his artistic competence and reputation soared, he continued to produce self-portraits, which is no doubt a mark of his constant endeavors in evaluating himself and his growth as an artist.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopper’s childhood home in Nyack on the Hudson River played a key role in nurturing his artistic pursuit and thematic interest in the contrast between nature and the built environment. <em>Artist’s Bedroom, Nyack</em> (c. 1905&ndash;1906) set in Hopper’s bedroom shows a self-portrait, sketches, books, and notes. The composition of Hopper’s later work <em>Stairway</em> (1949), in which the artist revisits his childhood home in Nyack, turns the viewer’s gaze from the house as a symbol of civilization to the mysterious landscape of lush foliage outside. The shadowy forest, which often appears as an antipode of civilization in Hopper’s works, both invites and obstructs the viewer, thereby emphasizing boundaries. In addition, such interior motifs as stairs, windows, and front doors set a boundary between inside and outside, direct the eye to move between different worlds, and serve as visual devices that evoke imagination.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Paris</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In 1906, Edward Hopper headed to Paris, funded by his assignments as an illustrator, to pursue his artistic vision. Widely considered the capital of art at the time, Paris with its graceful features and orderly streets made a sharp contrast with New York, a city subjected to constant development. Hopper visited Paris three times between 1906 and 1910. He spent his time exploring the city’s streets and its suburbs and closely observing nature, architecture, and people. In addition, he traveled to other European cities to see the works of master painters.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this journey of finding new subject matter and inspiration in new environments, Hopper gradually transformed his art with each visit. When he first arrived in Paris in the fall of 1906, he was still under the influence of his teacher Robert Henri. The dark color palette he used to express the interior of the Baptist church near his lodging as well as the surrounding cityscape, which included maroons and dark greys, likely developed from the teachings of Henri. However, Hopper quickly became inspired by Impressionism emphasizing the effects of light rather than avant-garde Fauvism and Cubism, and he began painting more actively outdoors by 1907. His works featuring the Seine River, nearby architecture, and sky show bright tones, quick brushstrokes, and soft light. Hopper paid attention to the contrast between light and shadow as well as architectural elements such as the river banks of the Seine, the Louvre Museum, and the bridges. The emergence of a composition resembling a photographic frame indicated the start of Hopper’s own painting style.&nbsp;</p><p>Once he became accustomed to painting outdoors, Hopper began to observe the daily life of Parisians. The lively city offered fascinating subject matter from dawn till dusk for Hopper, who went on to create thirty-three watercolors caricaturing laborers, prostitutes, janitors, cafe-goers, and people dressed in fashionable clothes. Later, his observations and depictions of everyday life and people were reimagined in<em>&nbsp;Le Bistro or The Wine Shop&nbsp;</em>(1909) and <em>Soir Bleu</em> (1914). Completed in New York, these two paintings are important early examples of Hopper’s realism, which started from a composition based on actual observations but came to fruition in combination with memory and imagination.</p><p><em>Soir Bleu</em> shows an assortment of people in a Parisian cafe: on the far left, a working-class man; in the center, a prostitute, a clown, an artist smoking a cigarette, and on the far right, a bourgeois couple. It is worth noting that <em>Soir Bleu</em>, which was painted in New York four years after Hopper’s final trip to Paris, hints at his mature style characterized by human disconnection and the depiction of the psychological landscape. However, when it was exhibited at the MacDowell Club of New York City in 1915, Hopper received harsh criticism because the movement to develop independent art in the United States called for scenes from New York, not Paris. Having made New York his permanent home after his third visit to Europe, Hopper was consequently prompted to capture the American landscape.</p><p><br><strong>New York</strong></p><p><br></p><p><em>After I took up etching my painting seemed to crystallize.</em> <a href='#_ftn1' name='_ftnref1' title=''>[4]</a></p><p><br></p><p>In 1915, Edward Hopper, who had not given up his dream of becoming an artist even amidst the tedious reality of working as an illustrator for a living, turned to etching?a printmaking technique in which lines are emphasized. Following his purchase of an etching press in 1916, Hopper produced dozens of prints, many of which show scenes of New York. His early etchings use vivid yet rough lines to depict New York’s residential districts, high-rise buildings, and bustling streets, thereby reflecting the explosive population growth and urban development at the time. Moreover, they provide insight into the development of transportation systems such as the elevated trains and railroads. Hopper was often drawn to the lights illuminating the city at night, and empty, dark street corners. As a result, etching served as an important medium for Hopper to study the effects of light and shadow, and paved the way for the subject matter, composition, and expression found in his later paintings. Hopper’s etchings were favorably received, allowing him to gain recognition as an artist.</p><p>Edward Hopper moved to New York City in 1908, and spent the rest of his life there until his death in 1967. New York was the American city that Hopper knew best and liked most. For Hopper, the urban landscape of New York and the daily lives of New Yorkers were objects of observation and became the subject matter of much of his art. From 1899 to 1908, he commuted to New York City by train and ferry from Nyack. His experience of traveling from the quiet suburb to the city and witnessing the changing landscape further deepened his lifelong interest in travel and modes of transportation, which can be seen in <em>Ferry Slip</em> (c. 1904-1906) and <em>Tugboat with Black Smokestack</em> (1908).</p><p>The scenery of parks located among New York’s skyscrapers was one of Hopper’s favorite materials. He moved to 3 Washington Square North in Greenwich Village in 1913, and lived there for the rest of his life. He was interested in Washington Square Park, which was visible from his window, and Central Park in the heart of the city. In particular, Hopper left numerous studies of the statue of Shakespeare in Central Park at dusk. He seemed to have projected literary inspiration drawn from the light and shadow cast by the evening sun, and the mysterious ambience created by the darkness.</p><p>In the early 20th century, New York was transforming into a metropolis (today’s Greater New York). The formation of skyscrapers, subways and railroads was followed by the widespread distribution of automobiles, and the construction of bridges and highways. However, Hopper was interested in capturing the city’s old, crumbling 19th-century architecture rather than the spectacle of the bustling cityscape. He set himself apart from other painters of his time by depicting Blackwell’s Island in the East River, riverfront apartments, and the expansiveness of long bridges?instead of the vertical skylines of skyscrapers. His unique perspective was likely shaped by his travels between New York and New England, where he witnessed buildings of various styles and eras in the countryside, as well as the railroads that crossed different neighborhoods. Furthermore, the top-down perspective is reminiscent of Hopper’s gaze from the elevated train (also known as ‘El’).&nbsp;</p><p>Hopper focused on observing and depicting the inner psychological landscape of metropolitan life unfolding in social spaces and private spaces. His observational gaze into the interior from the outside captured individuals’ daily lives through the window, a motif Hopper often used to connect inside and outside.&nbsp;Jo&nbsp;Hopper’s note on Study for<em>&nbsp;Nighthawks</em> (1941 or 1942) reads “bit of bright ceiling inside shop against dark of outside street at the edge of stretch of top of the window.” The illuminated interior space contrasts with the darkness outside the window, thereby creating a sense of disconnection as if time has stopped.</p><p>During the Roaring Twenties or the Jazz Age, Americans became enthusiastic about theaters, restaurants, and sporting events.&nbsp;Hopper and Josephine’s shared love for theater meant they frequented Broadway and other venues. He depicts the backs of figures seated facing the stage, or forlorn figures before, during, or after performances.</p><p>The unique characteristics of Hopper's realism are evident in his painting and studies set in theaters. In numerous sketches, he studied elements of the city’s theaters, later combining various aspects of each in his paintings. He often portrayed such ornate architectural details as the proscenium arches and orchestra pits of theaters like the Palace and the Sheridan, bringing them together in compositions built from observation and imagination.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><a href='#_ftnref1' name='_ftn1' title=''>[4]</a> Hopper, as quoted in Suzanne Burrey, “Edward Hopper: The Emptying Spaces,” <em>Arts Digest</em>, April 1, 1955, 10.

(New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 2022), 19.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>From City to Coast</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Edward Hopper’s American landscape paintings are not realistic representations of the landscape as it is. Rather, Hopper reimagined the American landscape in his work. In his painting <em>Railroad Sunset&nbsp;</em>(1929), a signal tower stands starkly against green hills and a spectacular sunset next to a railroad track. Hopper added imaginary details to what appears to be a scene glimpsed from a train window. In 1929, the year that he completed this painting, Hopper and his wife traveled from New York to Charleston, South Carolina, as well as to Massachusetts and Maine.<a href='#_ftn1' name='_ftnref1' title=''>[5]</a> The images that he encountered on the road left a lasting impression, and continued to inspire the artist for years to come.</p><p><br></p><p><a href='#_ftnref1' name='_ftn1' title=''>[5]</a> “Edward Hopper, <em>Railroad Sunset</em>, 1929,” Whitney Museum of American Art. https://whitney.org/collection/works/5874, [accessed in October, 2022].&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>New England</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Hopper spent several summers in Maine, one of six states in the Northeastern United States that together comprise the region of New England, which was home to the Puritans’ first settlement in America. The artist first explored the New England coastline in 1912, when he traveled to Gloucester, Massachusetts, and began painting outdoors; afterwards, he returned to other coastal sites in Massachusetts and Maine, as well as the mountains and farms of Vermont and New Hampshire.</p><p>In 1914 and 1915, Hopper spent time in Ogunquit<a href='#_ftn1' name='_ftnref1' title=''>[6]</a>, Maine, a small fishing village surrounded by three miles of sandy shoreline. Between 1916 and 1919, he made four trips to Monhegan Island<a href='#_ftn2' name='_ftnref2' title=''>[7]</a>, Maine, which is surrounded by some of the highest ocean cliffs on the Maine coastline. Carrying oil paints and small panel supports, he walked along the rocky shore and created sketches and improvisational works.<a href='#_ftn3' name='_ftnref3' title=''>[8]</a> Hopper’s works from this period are characterized by particularly dynamic and expressive features such as the stark color contrast between reflected light and shadows, the masses of rocks emphasized through impasto, and the bold compositions created by steep coastal cliffs and the surrounding crashing waves.<a href='#_ftn4' name='_ftnref4' title=''>[9]</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Hopper’s time in New England greatly impacted his personal life. In the summer of 1923 in Gloucester, Maine, he began courting Josephine Verstille Nivison, a former classmate and artist, whom he married in 1924. Under Josephine's influence, Hopper started painting watercolors outdoors, and soon after, she helped him display these works at the Brooklyn Museum. Hopper’s watercolors produced during this period were well-received in the art world, and led to sales, thereby opening up opportunities for him to become a full-time painter. For Hopper, his travels around New England offered him a chance to gain inspiration and try new things through encounters with new environments away from the city.</p><p><br></p><p><a href='#_ftnref1' name='_ftn1' title=''>[6]</a> Repeated visits by Winslow Homer (1836-1910), a celebrated traditional American landscape painter turned Ogunquit into a hub for artists.</p><p><a href='#_ftnref2' name='_ftn2' title=''>[7]</a> Monhegan Island was a favorite destination among many of Hopper’s contemporaries, including Robert Henry, Rockwell Kent, and George Bellows. Hopper said, “Maine is so beautiful and the weather is so fine in the summer - that's why I come here to rest and to paint a little too.” Carol Troyen, <em>Edward Hopper’s Maine</em> (Maine: Bowdoin College Museum of Art Brunswick, 2011), 17.</p><p><a href='#_ftnref3' name='_ftn3' title=''>[8]</a> Carol Troyen, <em>Edward Hopper’s Maine</em>, 18.</p><p><a href='#_ftnref4' name='_ftn4' title=''>[9]</a> Lenora Mamunes, <em>Edward Hopper Encyclopedia</em> (North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Co, Inc., 2011), 82.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cape Cod</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In 1925, Edward Hopper and his wife traveled across the United States by train. Two years later, in 1927, they purchased a secondhand car, and then enjoyed traveling to places like the American West and Mexico throughout the rest of their lives. As Lloyd Goodrich, a longtime acquaintance of Hopper and former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York reflected, “this preoccupation with the concept of travel is quite conscious; he has said that his themes often come to him when driving.”<a href='#_ftn1' name='_ftnref1' title=''>[10]</a> The widespread use of automobiles and the expansion of roads at the time facilitated the Hoppers’ travels, which can be seen as a temporary escape from socioeconomic problems such as urbanization and the Great Depression.</p><p>Captivated by the charms of New England, Hopper and his wife arrived in Truro on southern Cape Cod in June 1930, and rented a small cottage from A.B. Burleigh Cobb, the village postmaster for the summer. With its long stretches of coastline, fine sand dunes, homes scattered among low hills, rustic farmhouse barns, and wide green nature basking in warm sunlight, the small village of about 500 people was a perfectly serene place for Hopper to get away from the hustle and bustle of New York and focus on his work.<a href='#_ftn2' name='_ftnref2' title=''>[11]</a> After Josephine came into an inheritance, and the couple set up their own home in Truro in 1934, the couple would summer on Cape Cod and return to New York City in early autumn for the rest of their lives.</p><p>From the late 1930s, Hopper began infusing his paintings with images from his memory and imagination. His artistic voice continued to mature as he sought subjects that captured the contrast between reality and fantasy, nature and artifice, which could relate to his own experience of traveling between the city and the countryside.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopper’s impressions of the forests near Truro and the houses and beach cottages that dot the landscape gave rise to the paintings<em>&nbsp;Cape Cod Sunset</em> (1934), and<em>&nbsp;Second Story Sunlight&nbsp;</em>(1960). Both works capture the atmospheric conditions of summer days along the coast but focus attention on the dramatic potential of light and the ways that architecture and the environment intersect.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Josephine Hopper, <em>Seven A.M.</em> (1948) depicts a “blind pig,” or illegal drinking establishment located in Nyack. Completed in Cape Cod in 1948, fifteen years after the repeal of Prohibition, Seven A.M. shows the artist’s distinctive realist characteristics created by moving back and forth in time and space. The title itself is worth noting. With a specified time and place, it implies that Hopper paid attention to the movement of the sun and varying degrees of brightness in the space he explored.</p><p><br></p><p><a href='#_ftnref1' name='_ftn1' title=''>[10]</a> Lenora Mamunes, <em>Edward Hopper Encyclopedia</em> (North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Co, Inc., 2011), 31.</p><p><a href='#_ftnref2' name='_ftn2' title=''>[11]</a> Lenora Mamunes, 11-12.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Josephine Hopper</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Josephine Nivison Hopper (1883-1968) enrolled at the New York School of Art in 1905, and studied under Robert Henri. By 1914, she was a promising young artist, presenting her work in group exhibitions with modernist artists such as Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, and Charles Burchfield. Under her influence, Edward Hopper began painting watercolors in 1923, as the two painted outdoors together in Gloucester, Massachusetts. She arranged for Hopper’s watercolors to be included in an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum. One of his watercolors was selected to be included in the museum’s collection, and received wide critical acclaim.</p><p>The couple married in 1924, but often clashed due to differences in personality. Nevertheless, the couple shared passion for literature, cinema, theater, and France, exchanged artistic inspiration, and traveled around the United States, Canada, and Mexico, where they enjoyed painting outdoors together.&nbsp;</p><p>Above all, Josephine was Hopper’s greatest supporter. Unlike her reticent husband, she had an outgoing personality, and thus acted as his publicist promoting his work and interacting with the dealers, collectors, curators, and journalists. She was also Hopper’s long standing muse. Based on her experience of being on the stage with the Washington Square Players in 1910s, she frequently posed for her husband’s paintings, and studies of her posing can be found in many of Hopper’s drawings.</p><p>Josephine served as Hopper’s manager, keeping ledger books that documented his works, exhibitions and sales for more than thirty years. After her husband’s death, she donated some 2,500 pieces of Hopper’s artworks and materials to Whitney Museum of American Art. Josephine’s thorough and meticulous records of the details of Hopper’s work, which the taciturn artist often failed to mention, are major historical sources of his life and work.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hopper’s Life and Career</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Drawing from the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the Sanborn Hopper Archive, Hopper’s Life and Career details the artist’s life and art. It is largely divided into ‘Journey’, ‘Illustration’, ‘The Hoppers’, ‘Hopper’s View’ and ‘Documentary’.</p><p>‘Journey’ focuses on Hopper’s time in Paris. While he later traveled throughout the United States and Mexico, he spent his early years visiting Paris. He made three extended visits between 1906 and 1910 and during his trips abroad, he also visited Amsterdam, Berlin, London, and Madrid. This section features photographs from Paris, his annotated map of Europe, as well as letters and a postcard to his mother. His travels allowed him to awaken his gaze, and develop a distinctive style of depicting nature, cities, and everyday scenes with his own unique perspective and composition.</p><p>‘Illustration’ presents a selection of Hopper’s advertising illustrations, magazine covers, and magazine illustrations from the two decades (1906-1925) before he achieved success as a painter. As an illustrator, he keenly observed the cityscape of New York and the daily lives of New Yorkers, which then prompted him to capture the present state of America.</p><p>‘The Hoppers’ features photographs of the couple, the theater tickets they collected, and four ledger books. The ledgers are the most important records of Hopper’s career. The Hoppers made copious notes and sketches of his ideas. From the time he sold his first work in 1913, Hopper and his wife Jo kept detailed records of sales, loans, and exhibitions of his works. After Hopper completed a work, he would make a small sketch of it in the ledger, and Jo then added lively descriptions of the work, often imagining anecdotal details that Hopper?a man of few words?never discussed himself. Their life and artistic endeavors are chronicled in the documentaries <em>Visual Art in America</em> (1965), produced in their later years, and <em>Hopper: An American Love Story&nbsp;</em>(2022).</p><p>Finally, ‘Hopper’s View’ presents the brochure for <em>Early Paintings</em> (1941), an exhibition of Hopper’s Parisian-themed paintings from the early 1900s; a statement that he submitted with other artists to <em>Reality: A Journal of Artists’ Opinions</em> (1953) as a form of resistance to the trend in American art toward abstraction and his interview with John D. Morse conducted in 1959 for the Archives of American Art. In particular, in the interview with John Morse, Hopper read from his best-known writing, <em>Notes on Painting&nbsp;</em>(1933), and his statement published in <em>Reality: A Journal of Artists’ Opinions</em>, both of which can be heard in the Crystal Gallery on the third floor.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2023%2F&FILE_NM=20230314155649_dca6c295f6e94665a0e625245733258e_5327af24185c440da02dcbfc5ba58c03,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1152744,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Familiar to us as the translator of Ernst Gombrich’s The Story of Art and John Berger‘s Ways of Seeing, and as a founding member of the art movement group “Reality and Utterance,” he was a mediator between literature and art, art and video, art and society, art and the public, expanding the fields of visual culture, and his work carries great significance.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Choi Min Collection consists of 161 artworks and 24,924 other materials that he collected during his life, all of which were donated to the Seoul Museum of Art in 2019-2020. The materials, including 21,000 books, match the scale of an entire library. The charming potential of this collection is that by traversing different ages, languages and fields, it serves as a catalyst that can promote diverse approaches and interpretations transcending art itself. But at the same time, it also presents a challenge: while the books definitely influenced him as background for his thoughts, their effect was indirect, and it is hard to prove any direct causal relationship. Therefore, in order to grasp and understand these materials, active research is essential to determine their relationship to Choi.</p><p><br></p><p>This exhibition has been composed on the basis of findings through research on the Choi Min Collection, conducted for more than a year by researchers from diverse fields including art, cinema, literature and bibliography. The participating researchers carefully followed and explored contexts in the materials, accumulated during this one person’s lifetime, while also considering them from the newer perspective of today. The exhibition presents their interpretations and evaluations of the various inflection points in Choi Min’s life, as his thoughts and writings extend to art and again to image and cinema, attempting to illuminate their significance. In addition, the show will feature commission works by various artists who have translated and interpreted the senses evoked by the Choi Min Collection into photographic and video language, and selected materials through which spectators can glimpse aspects of Choi that were previously unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Cheerful Learning, Delightful Knowledge, Joyful Knowing” was a memo that Choi left in one of his books?the French edition of The Gay Science. Like Nietzsche’s aphorism, which encourages intellectual courage, it serves as a metaphor for Choi Min, who transcended the borders between rigid times, discourses and media to open the future for the world of images through free and flexible thinking. We hope that this exhibition will be an arena for delightful sharing of the fascinating knowledge that Choi passes on to the next generations.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The event will take place in five locations. An overview of the Choi Min Collection, Theme-Based Research presenting results of in-depth research and interpretation of the materials, and works by Hong Goo Kang, Jaeyeon Kim &amp; Sunho Nam, Eun Chun, Jiin Juen, and Minseung Jang, who have expressed their explorations on Choi Min and his collection through photography, video and installation, can be seen in Gallery 1 and 2 of the Collaborating Space, the Exchanging Space, and the Learning Space, while the Research Lab will exhibit historical materials exploring the relation between image and narrative among the Collection. Specialists in the fields of classical literature, bibliography, urban research, comparative literature, art history and cinema will participate in film screening programs, archive workshops, and special local culture lectures, serving as guides for the Collection, which itself is a testimony to this diverse research adventure crossing over the borders of discipline, language and culture.&nbsp;</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2023%2F&FILE_NM=20230401145740_c4da1bd29d534c32a843d5a07fcefb2d_f7233a05531a4a889ba632f893f1805e,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1158523,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
1076473,493,[Emerging Artists & Curators] Ahree Song's solo exhibition Cold Green Base,,SeMA Bunker,2022-08-17,2022-09-04,,,Seoul Museum of Art,Tue-Sun 11a.m.-7p.m. Closed on Mon & 1st Jan  Open only during exhibitions,,"Sculptural Installation, Performance",,,"Artist Ahree Song has focused on the notion of the transformed body to analyze a relationship between different beings that free themselves from the skin of the body and yearn for a different world. She has constantly conducted experiments on contemplating the interface of binary oppositions, (e.g., between human beings and nature, machines and organisms, materials and non-materials, and purebred and hybrid) and learning their survival strategies. Her work has been included in numerous exhibitions, including those at the Manifest Gallery, Cincinnati (2019); Arnot Art Museum, New York (2019); Windmill, Seoul (2022); AlterSide, Seoul (2022).","<p><em>Cold Green Base</em> is an exhibition that explores the bodies of human and non-human beings based on the deep sea. Artist Ahree Song displays her performative sculptures that reflect her ideas and experiences related to the transformed body. She mainly uses transparent materials to represent the material-semiotic notion and metaphorically indicate anti-purity. This exhibition consists of sculptures of plants living in the deep sea that Ahree created based on her artistic imagination and performances representing the movements of these plants. Sculptures of eight species of plants rooting in the SeMA Bunker, an artist specializing in arts, and a dancer specializing in modern dance connect with others based on their bodies and repeatedly perform synthesis and replacement. <em>Cold Green Animal&nbsp;</em>(2022) indicates sculptures that Ahree created by inserting seawater that she collected in brick-shape molds, freezing the inserted seawater to fill the molds with ice, and wrapping the surfaces with transparent tape. When the frozen seawater, which is the main material for the sculptures, melts and drains out of the bodies, these rectangular shells do not contain ice that filled them and eventually reveal numerous traces of things, such as floating matters, salt particles, and water. <em>Cold Green Plant&nbsp;</em>(2022) indicates performances that display dynamic aspects of plants, which move intensely with strong instincts for survival, in an enlarged way. Two performers imitate plants’ movements in the deep sea by wearing wearable sculptures in dark green color, like seaweed. They move as sculptures and can be in a stationary state only temporarily.

View the sculptures from various perspectives, and feel how their forms change. 2. Try to find common visual characteristics in the works, made in different mediums and from different periods. 3. Examine how the artist’s work changed in form when she came into contact with a new material (such as the tree from Argentina that is harder and wider than trees from Korea). 4. Through various archive materials like photographs and exhibition brochures, explore the activities and environment of the art world around the artist. 5. Carefully examine how the single material of the tree can be created into a diverse range of works with different forms and impressions.","<p><em>Kim Yunshin: Towards Oneness</em> is a solo exhibition by Kim Yunshin, one of the first-generation female sculptors in Korea, born in 1935 and still actively engaged in her art practice. This exhibition portrays Kim’s free-spirited artistic journey through over 70 works by the artist, including her sculptures in wood, stone, as well as lithographic works. Kim is relatively less known in Korea because she worked mainly in Argentina since moving there in 1983. However, her artless sense of form fully brings the natural attributes of material to life, and demonstrates both a sense of uniqueness as well as universality which transcend time and place. Based on her philosophical thoughts on nature and universe, Kim’s sculptures in traditional form produced through laborious physical actions of the artist question the meaning of the actual sensations of the material which become numb in the digital age. Kim is still weaving the Korean sculpture history today as the very history herself, breathing together with the contemporary age.</p><p><br></p><p>Born in 1935 in Wonsan, Gangwon province (North Korea), Kim experienced the tumultuous history of the Korean peninsula in the 20<sup>th</sup> century at an early age, including the liberation of Korea and the Korean War. This ironically eliminated her fears in making new challenges. Kim graduated from the Department of Sculpture in Hongik University and left to study in the School of Sculpture at Ecole nationale superieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. In the art capital of the world at the time, Kim immersed herself in the latest art trends and developed her sculptural sensibilities through diverse experiments. Kim returned to Korea in 1969, and for ten or so years before moving to Argentina, she led the Korea Sculptress Association as one of the first-generation female sculptors of Korea. Kim demonstrated her successful practice as an artist in the Korean sculpture world, participating in exhibitions like the <em>12<sup>th</sup> Sao Paulo Biennale</em> in 1973. In the midst of such prosperous artistic career, Kim decided to move to Argentina in 1984, purely out of her desires to explore new materials as an artist and expand her practice. The hard wood she came across in Argentina allowed the artist to express the architectural structure and the dense sense of force in her work. Kim continued to explore the new material while living in Mexico from 1988 to 1991, and in Brazil from 2001 to 2002. Kim’s artistic journey is still ongoing in 2023, at the artist’s age of 88.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Add Two Add One, Divide Two Divide One</em> is a title the artist has been applying to her works since the late 1970s. The words “add” and “divide” originate from Eastern philosophy of Yin and Yang, and are fundamental ideas that explain the creation of the world and universe. Darkness and light cannot exist separately on their own and exist in correspondence with each other. Complementing seasons unfold in the world simultaneously, as it is summer in Korea when it’s winter in Argentina. The same goes for the bark and the inner wood of trees, an important element in wood sculpture. As such, yin and yang are two yet one, and one yet two. Kim realized that all matters in the universe are an infinite repetition of the interaction between “yin” (fragmentation and division) and “yang” (convergence and integration). In other words, two heterogeneous elements meet (“add two”) and become one through interaction (“add one”), and this sum is divided into two again (“divide two”) to each become one (“divide one”). Kim also explained that her sculptural process involves adding her soul to wood (add), dividing space in wood (divide), and becoming a perfect whole (artwork). This exhibition focuses on the philosophy of the artist’s representative work <em>Add Two Add One, Divide Two Divide One</em>, and presents her oeuvre in 4 sections which focus on different forms of art: Lithography, Stone sculpture, Wood sculpture, and Kim’s recent works produced in Korea.</p><p><br></p><p>The human physical contact with each other was inevitably reduced to the minimum for the past three years due to external factors. As most activities were replaced with online ones, however, the thirst for actual physical contact and real sensations ironically increased. This is why Kim’s work, which utilizes nature as its material, is so captivating. The sensation of primitive nature in Kim’s work embraces the audience with a sense of stability and significance that contrasts with the virtual lightness that’s easily volatilized. Kim’s works offer the viewers the opportunity to restore their fundamental sensations that have become numb, to feel themselves as a part of nature and the universe, and bond with them. Furthermore, this exhibition will further the interest and research on Kim, who has always lived as one with art and hopefully revive the history of female sculptors in Korea.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2023%2F&FILE_NM=20230302173708_70031c44d83e4254a5fd1fda6a11e569_4c428b6a035340358394a77d4b766428,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1148153,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The project <em>Sky Blue</em> introduces Dongju Kang's work <em>The Sky of 155minutes 37seconds</em> suspended near the facade of the building.*</p><p dir='ltr'>The inside and outside of the Buk Seoul Museum of Art visually seems connected through the glass windows scattered throughout the building. In particular, the facade, which measures about three stories high, is made entirely of a single glass window, providing a wide open view. The corridor right next to the window functions as a type of view point through which to look at the outside landscape. <em>The Sky of 155minutes 37seconds</em> is installed in the space between this corridor and the glass window. The canvas capturing the deepening night sky after sunset starts with blue light and gradually shifts to a darker tone. On the other hand, meteorological elements in the real landscape beyond the work, like the light and color of the sky, the air, and wind, change constantly. This means that the combination of the work and the actual landscape is different for each viewer each time, depending on the time of the day and the weather at the moment of looking at the work.</p><p dir='ltr'>The title <em>Sky Blue</em> reminds the viewer of the infinite sense of the sky and an element of daily life. One can feel more relaxed and liberated from troubles of life just by looking up at the boundless sky. It’s no wonder that “blue-sky thinking” is a term that references a way of brainstorming through freely exchanging ideas. Also, the sky is naturally a part of our everyday life. As we look at the sky, we find ourselves in awe of its beauty, guessing the weather, or casually talking about the sky with people around us.</p><p dir='ltr'>A picture of the sky is something that we can easily find in our smart phones. As close we are to the sky, the sky has an extraordinary sense of power that attracts us to it. On our way out from the museum, let’s all take a pause for a moment, and take a look at the sky above us.</p><p dir='ltr'>&nbsp;</p><p dir='ltr'>* <em>The </em><em>Sky of 155minutes 37seconds</em> is one of the works presented in the artist’s 2013 solo exhibition <em>Subcenter</em>.&nbsp;This exhibition focuses on neighborhoods of Cheongnyangni, where the artist was born and grew up, and Yeongdeungpo, which was also designated a subcentral city and went through a similar redevelopment period as Cheongnyangni. The works in the exhibition interpreted the time of the artist’s movement throughout Seoul after sunset through the language of light, moon and sky.</p><p dir='ltr'>The exhibition <em>Subcenter</em> is based on the artist’s video work portraying Seoul’s night landscape. <em>The Sky of 155minutes 37seconds</em> is a series of oil paintings on canvas rendering stills of the sky from this video work, and expresses the time of the sky capturing the traces of the city structure. “155 Minutes and 37 Seconds” from the title of the work also signifies the duration of the video where the sky is featured. A total of 156 paintings were produced as a result of converting 1 minute of the video into 1 canvas.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20221228093201_0eaf9dd2996b497fb1ff515ecc2d751b_a9e749a933a54914afc7d2bde68f4ef8,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1126328,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
1115659,505,Kiki Smith ? Free Fall,,Seosomun Main Branch,2022-12-15,2023-03-12,,,"Organized by Seoul Museum of Art, Sponsored by Herm&#232;s Korea",,,"sculpture, prints, photographs, tapestry, artist's book, etc",Approx. 140 pcs,Kiki Smith,,"<p><em>Kiki Smith - Free Fall</em> is Kiki Smith’s first solo exhibition held at a public museum in Asia. Kiki Smith occupies a unique space in contemporary American art of the 1980-90s through her deconstructive expression of the body and continues to be active in her practice. “Free Fall,” which is also the title of Smith’s work produced in 1994, points to the eruptive and vital energy as well as the wandering movement inherent in Smith’s work, bringing together the past forty years of her vast media experiments and artistic practice that engaged in weaving transcultural narratives that go beyond mere female-centric narratives. It also symbolizes Smith’s dynamism implicit in her exploration of the fragmented body, but it also conveys her performative posture that allowed her to expand the boundaries of media and concepts through a kind of wandering akin to the moon’s free-falling orbit around the Earth. Based on these characteristics, the exhibition introduces more than 140 works ranging from sculptures, prints, photographs, tapestries, and artist’s books.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>America in the 1980s, which is when Kiki Smith began her practice in earnest, can be summarized by its focus on human rights, equality, identity, and gender discourse with issues surrounding AIDS and abortion rights. Smith, having lost her father and her sister who died from AIDS during this time, peered into life’s frailty and imperfections. Combined with her interest in anatomy, these contexts create an opportunity for her to bore into the border between the inside and outside of the body. With her non-hierarchical approach in her exploration of the body, Smith became a key figure of abject art, boldly dealing with the segmented and fragmented body as well as bodily fluids like menstrual blood, sweat, tears, semen, urine, and other excreta. From the 2000s on, she has been gradually expanding the radius of her work to include subjects like animals, nature, and the universe, as well as other media, endeavoring to articulate a nonlinear narrative that blurs boundaries.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The artist said that the reason she became interested in the body was not simply to emphasize the feminine in a new way but “because it is the one form that we all share; it’s something that everybody has their own authentic experience with,” and it is this multiplicity of interpretations that became a crucial starting point of this exhibition. The exhibition, thus, proposes three loosely connected themes of <em>Beyond Unknown, Wandering Self,&nbsp;</em>and <em>Free Fall&nbsp;</em>based on elements such as narrative structure, recurring elements, or energy, which can be found consistently throughout her oeuvre, from her early works to her more recent works.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Smith has called her own artistic practice a kind of “walking around in a garden.” This symbolizes the wandering movement of a thought that lingers around various media and concepts as well as their borders. And this movement is fully transferred to the screen today, with reverence for all life that is marginalized, insignificant, or not yet reached. Having gone through the 1980s-90s up to the present day, repeating to adapt and run counter to the undulations of the times, Smith says, “I am still in free-fall.” Her attentiveness to “all creatures great and small” and casting a message of coexistence with a deep, considered breath are indeed values worth paying attention to again today when terms like excess, inundation, and surplus have become all too familiar.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20221206043005_42a2537ce1544184b513c26c6329a3a9_bc7d1d6a57044a13bf45ce1f647e72d7,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1115659,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
1112904,504,seok ho kang: Three Minute Delight,,Seosomun Main Branch,2022-12-15,2023-03-19,,,Seoul Museum of Art,,,,About 200 artworks,seok ho kang,,"<p>Seoul Museum of Art has put forward ‘production’ and ‘poetry’ as its institutional and exhibition agenda in 2022, proposing the recovery of the senses through art creation and its implications. <em>seok ho kang: Three Minute Delight</em> is both the last exhibition of this unit and the first retrospective of seok ho kang(1971-2021) who has extended the sphere of his aesthetic preference to furniture collection and production from painting couched in his own intrinsic pictorial idioms. This exhibition pays heed to his remarkable creativity that crosses the boundaries between plane and solid, art and everyday life, and hobby and task. And this exhibition serves as a special opportunity to engender poetic emotions and rhythms that are pervasive both in his work and the daily world by displaying his paintings alongside snippets of his writings, pieces from his collection, and pieces of furniture he made himself.<br><br><em>Three Minute Delight</em> is the title of his essay that captures a one-day journey. A period of three minutes to Kang is a brief span of time he uses to keep a distance from triteness in his everyday life. The time he spends outside his studio walking and collecting something is important to keep his freedom and balance inside the studio. He used to indulge in appreciating the aesthetic of furniture when he was not involved in painting as he cross-references his work and daily life. As Kang’s everyday life and art are thought of as inseparable, this exhibition is designed to have a layout in which visitors can view his products including his paintings by series and furniture collection as if flowing and walking without constraint.<br><br>The subtitles of each section refer to keywords such as everyday life, formativeness, utopia, and walk which were important in Kang’s life. The time one spends representing beauty in a visible reality also inspires others so it is worth promoting and inheriting. <em>seok ho kang: Three Minute Delight</em> is more than a showcase of Kang’s paintings that have thus far been displayed in a variety of exhibitions. As a starting point for coming research on the artists, this exhibition puts more emphasis on the encounter with the audience who has inherited the artist’s inspiration. We look forward to this exhibition and hope it serves as an opportunity for sharing all our experiences with and sensations of Kang’s art, as if reading his essay or strolling in our everyday lives.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20221209180441_a8174eb41a33431dab301afaaedc4509_ee57619ef0f44ac4a34a88647b87b43c,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1112904,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

There is no such thing as seeing purely and surely. Seeing is bound to change from moment to moment, influenced by the viewer's past experiences, preconceived notions, values, and direct information and knowledge from outside.”</strong></p><p><strong>&ndash; Choi Min, excerpt from “Art Works and Text” (1981)</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The Choi Min Collection is a collection of 161 works and about 25,000 items of materials accumulated by the art critic Choi Min (1944-2018) throughout his life, which was donated to the City of Seoul and the Seoul Museum of Art by his family in 2019-2020. A widely-acclaimed critic, poet, educator, translator and curator, Choi also wrote and worked in a wide range of cultural and artistic fields, including fine art, film, photography and literature. He was the founding member of the art movement group Reality and Utterance which was established in 1979, and his assertion that art should reflect a new perception of reality in the new era influenced many artists at the time. For Choi, art was a variable which changed according to the needs of the times and society. Demonstrating deep and sharp insights, many of his writings are tremendously valuable as testimonies and records of an era.</p><p><br></p><p>The Choi Min Collection comprises a total of 161 works produced by 25 artists. Choi wrote exhibition reviews and artist essays for about 10 of the artists from 1983 to 2016. While Choi’s collection demonstrates an outstanding value as individual works, the collection is unparalleled in significance as a group of masterpieces that reflect a critic’s aesthetic viewpoint and his relationships with others. Choi had received his doctorate degree, researching the 'impact of film on painting' centering on the French school of thought Nouvelle&nbsp;Figuration. He strove to explore the unique artistic characteristics and correlations through comparative research between various art mediums at a time brimming over with brilliant images. His fascination with genres such as painting, film, and photography and realist aesthetics can also be seen in the composition of his collection. In addition, Choi expressed skepticism toward seeing the artist's life being completely separate from his works. Such perspective is reflected in his writings, which demonstrate Choi’s warm attentiveness on the artists, and his desires to see, read, and feel the works in multiple perspectives with a unique open attitude.</p><p><br></p><p>Excerpts from Choi's writings related to the collection accompany the works in this exhibition to be read together. The exhibition suggests the way a critic sees the works as reflected in Choi’s remark, 'Unlike what is generally thought about a work, the work looks differently depending on the viewer.' When translating John Berger's book <em>Ways of Seeing</em>, Choi Min translated “Ways of Seeing” as “Seeing in a Different Way,” as opposed to multiple ways of seeing, emphasizing a new way of seeing that is different from the existing academic way. As there is not one standard way in seeing, a new way of seeing the works might be discovered in the light of his writing.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20221122161451_366459ffe4cb454c94dad46ba031a5de_a9b4465c0f8f418493c1429ccc5803a3,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1108624,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Celebrating its ninth rendition, this year’s Title Match invites IM Heung-soon and Omer Fast who work both as visual artists and filmmakers, presenting the essence of their artistic worlds of wide-ranging themes and artistic forms.</p><p>The thirteen artworks that consist of the 2022 Title Match exhibition tell us the stories at different paces. Instead of surveying the diverse works of IM Heung-soon and Omer Fast, the exhibition focuses on presenting the two artists’ most recent works that show the essence of the worlds they create. Such an approach will provide an opportunity to fully appreciate the moments at which the artists’ unique languages reach their peak to produce fruitful results. In addition, IM Heung-soon and Omer Fast premiere their new works in this exhibition, which are respectively titled The Waves and Garage Sale. These two works incorporate intimate and meta-elements in terms of framework, composition, content, and narrative technique. On the multi-channel screens, they unfold conceptual and complex thinking to explore the origin of the self and the world.</p><p>The focus of the current exhibition with regards to the encounter between IM Heung-soon and Omer Fast is what the worlds that the two artists respectively depict embody. In their work, the aspects of life are unfolded on the screen as memories, the past, and history persist in time and develop in complex ways. What they pursue then is to affirm the world as it is and look into the journey of the beings living within it. There, a creative will is inherent in the belief in the world of the present, not of another one, which is to constantly reconstruct the “world that remains to come even after it has been lost.”&nbsp;Combined with such an artistic will, the way the two artists compose the format of their work and interpret their medium endows a strong political character to their works. IM Heung-soon’s work maximizes the emotional aspects of the scene through sound, which functions as a dispositif of affect. The inevitability and impossibility are displayed at once by the installation of the screens inviting the audience to move in the space. In addition, through his collaborative works, IM examines the possibility of a political community. All of these ultimately emphasizes the ethics of the other and poetic hospitality. Based on film, Omer Fast’s work crosses different genres, such as photography and painting. His work creates a dense cinematic space through the intense encounter between diverse techniques ranging from 3D to motion capture and how the subject matter is presented. These reinforce the aesthetic politicity of his work. As such, the works of IM Heung-soon and Omer Fast survey the mediatic characteristics of video and realize a vast aesthetic project that explores the possibility of an ethical subject from the ongoings of the times and individuals.</p><p>“Cut!”, the exclamation at the end of the long title of an annual exhibition, is a shout to signify the “OK” sign by a film director. It also signifies a grammatical principle that is unique to the medium of video and serves as a metaphor for editing techniques. The very scenes, created through countless shooting and editing to create a world, are ultimately a “series of cut images.” <em>2022 Title Match: IM Heung-soon vs. Omer Fast “Cut!”</em> inherits the name of “Title Match.” And it also stands at a point on which it functions as a seam connecting the tradition and passes on its legacy by becoming part of the ongoing tradition of the annual exhibition. As such, it becomes a scene by itself as an image that distinguishes itself and connects different things at the same time. The audience is invited to become images that fill different scenes within the worlds depicted by the two artists’ works and the stories told by the characters on the screen. In doing so, the exhibition also imagines the audience becoming part of a circular structure without a beginning and an end. Just like the threads that are connected to each other, a scene in the exhibition comes to us as a story that is unwound and wound on another scene. It then becomes many possibilities that change our lives, transferred from within us onto the screen. As a result, the <em>2022 Title Match: IM Heung-soon vs. Omer Fast “Cut!”</em> will generate a deep resonance through the overlap of two worlds, which ultimately point to the same place amid differences in subject, point of view, and language.</p><p><br></p><p><span style='background-color: transparent;'>Image: Omer Fast,&nbsp;</span><em style='background-color: transparent;'>Garage Sale</em><span style='background-color: transparent;'>, 2022 ⓒ Omer Fast (Photo by Lukas Strebel)</span></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20221027135346_62ac3cafa74f4ec5a7d77451d9388842_583dc8c2d4744365aebd8a67808bb75c,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1099626,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Part 2 “Digital Culture and Artistic Praxis” will examine what the ways of artistic production and thinking are in the Digital Age and what the tasks for the exhibition and collection of the digital arts are.</p><p><br></p><p>The Seo-Seoul Museum of Art’s intermedia lab will be planned as an analogue and digital platform through which discussions on trans-locality and community and digital culture and media with people from diverse fields can be expanded while the complexity of cities can be interpreted, and new artworks can be created. Held this year as a pilot program, the intermedia lab’s “Dissonance,” under the topics of infrastructures, care, mobile media, and artistic research (production and interpretation), will attempt to rewrite shared experiences in contemporary society, where social dialogues lead not to communication but to conflict, by connecting or intersecting disparate examples. First, on the level of reinterpreting cities and local spaces, culture and a sense of solidarity generated in the interrelationship between infrastructures and care will be discovered and recorded. Second, the landscapes and emotional structures of contemporary society changed by mobile media, which provide interfaces linked by mobile technology and have emerged as the media most familiar to us, will be explored, and changes in digital communication after disasters such as COVID-19 will be explored. Third, in “Artistic Research: Production and Interpretation,” the research methods and creative processes of artists who explore the interrelationships between nature and the environment, technology and data, human and non-human, and history and culture will be shared, and examples of diverse commissioned works executed in order to promote artistic production in an era of changes will be examined. In addition, data from a variety of fields including finance, politics, technology, education, and work as well as interviews and conversations generated in the process of producing artist Ham Yang Ah’s <em>Undefined Panorama</em> (2018-) out of the SeMA’s collection will be shared within new structures that make use of the openness and expansiveness of the web, and new approaches to the arts will be explored together. Through this, the Seo-Seoul Museum of Art will encourage interdisciplinary research in the fields of the visual arts and prepare both an environment for artists’ production and a basis for audiences’ understanding and participation.</p><p><br></p><p>This pre-opening public program will proceed both online and onsite, at the SeMA Learning Station/Coral and on the Seo-Seoul Museum of Art website, and the topics and the contents of the dialogues of the pre-opening public program, which will continue for three years, are scheduled to be publicized through the Seo-Seoul Museum of Art website and publications.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20221007175424_c0bb75f818314ecb93beaccbf826e8d4_958dbd4513054c1da0af41de0ae19890,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1094744,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

1080199,497,Chung Seoyoung : What I Saw Today,,Seosomun Main Branch,2022-09-01,2022-11-13,http://chungseoyoung.com/,,Seoul Museum of Art,,,"Sculpture, Installation",33,Chung Seoyoung,,"<p dir='ltr'><em>Chung Seoyoung :&nbsp;</em><em>What I Saw Today&nbsp;</em></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>What I Saw Today, a solo exhibition by sculptor Chung Seoyoung (b. 1964), presents a total of thirty-three pieces, including her major works produced since 1993 and nine new works. Chung is widely recognized as an artist who played a leading role in promoting the contemporaneity of modern sculpture during the 1990s?the decade in which Korean contemporary art acquired diversity and individuality. To this day, she continues her artistic experiments, which malleably deal with the issue of sculpture across various media and fields including drawing, sound, video, and performance art. The title of the exhibition refers to the artist’s long-term habit of writing down the colors, textures, motions that are hard to define yet memorable fine residue at the end of the day. Therefore, What I Saw Today is the title of the artist’s notes on fragmentary thoughts, and a reflection of her formative perception that what we see is both a physical path to discerning the world and a platform for engaging with it.&nbsp;</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>Chung Seoyoung considers sculpture as a kind of relational “platform” that reveals a fluid state beyond a static object. Each of the diverse and complex elements impacting one another until the sculpture takes on a single form “moves, flows, appears, disappears, and then reappears.” As tangible and intangible fragments extant in fleeting thoughts, emotions, actions, objects, or situations, such elements are dispersed fluidly and independently within the broad spectrum of “I-object-world.” As such, “sculptural moments” refer to the points when these shortly share the same space-time, and form a relationship to reveal themselves; this is when a sculpture comes into existence. The first part of the exhibition includes three of her early works that fully embody the artist’s worldview and critical thinking. Lookout &nbsp;“subverts the consensus of known facts and beliefs about objects,” while Wave attempts to include the dynamic or the intangible in plastic arts. In addition, Chung’s unique language used in the forms of titles or text drawings is an autonomous and independent element, which undergoes the process of collision, conflict, selection, and extinction, and thus further diversifies the context. The single word “awe” added to -Awe permits various interpretations such as hesitation and wonder, implying new possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>Apart from the elaborate and complex process of awaiting the manifestation of “sculptural moments,” Chung’s works appear to be simple combinations of common materials at first glance. &nbsp;However, as she aims to “think minutely, yet show foolishly,” the seemingly simple and mundane elements in her works give rise to multi-layered semantic divisions, and paradoxically, the sparse void leaves room for rich implications. In this exhibition, such everyday materials as cloth, sponge, carpet, plastic, and rubber merge with the simple blank space to convey the unique properties of Chung’s art. The status of the objects chosen by the artist has changed significantly over the past 30 years; some materials are no longer produced, while newly adopted elements like light, sound, and text have expanded the realm of sculpture. The usage of traditional materials like bronze and stainless-steel wire on most recent works notes yet another expansion - in terms of reinterpreting the classics - in progress. What is even more intriguing is the arrangement of these thirty three works. Since the artist places a great emphasis on all the relationships and connections arising from the works on display, her representative works do not follow a chronological order. Rather, this exhibition presents a newly formed relationship between the works, as well as between the works and their locations. In particular, her new work A Bone in the Brain, placed in the center of the exhibition, functions as a focal point with its simple rectilinear bronze shapes connecting and branching out in different directions. The sculpture is reminiscent of the moment when fluid elements take on a skeletal form by instantly penetrating the space as one. Based on the way it dominates the entire exhibition space, A Bone in the Brain is expected to become yet another representative work of the artist.&nbsp;</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>The influence of social media such as YouTube and Instagram has been encroaching on our lives for some time. What we see and experience is expressed in the forms of instant images or videos, and responses from others as well as the number of “likes” and “hearts” impinge on our behavior and psychology. The general attitude towards works of art is no exception. The artwork itself has been reduced to a momentary object of a camera as we no longer focus on the artwork or experience it directly with our own eyes, and our appreciation of art is often dictated by feedback from others. As discussed earlier, Chung opts for concise, implicative, and intuitive expressions, which, in turn, may cause some inconvenience in understanding the works and make us rely on written explanations. However, the artists elucidates that there is “not one path to experiencing the intrinsic complexity of the work,” and urges us to “trust ourselves as its most important witnesses because any attempt to seek meanings can pose a barrier.” The World in the final part of the exhibition is a two-channel video installation that observes subtle changes in light and sound surrounding plasticine walnut pieces for 10 minutes delving into the issue of focusing on something for an extended period of time. Indeed, “sculptural moments” are short-lived, but Chung carefully studies objects for a long time in order to capture and understand such moments. On the contrary, how much time and effort do we put into engaging with the work? Perhaps the title of the exhibition, What I Saw Today, is a succinct yet compelling &nbsp;request from the artist to “look at the work” without being restrained by anything else.&nbsp;</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>“Taking a bird’s-eye-view of objects brings to light the relationships and movements that have been established within. The complex appearance is due to the fact that the meanings pruned and grafted with the passage of time interact with one another. Any disruption in the link between such interactions produces simple units. Among them, my sculpture selects those that contain everyday complexity, and creates conditions for another experience.” &nbsp;- Chung Seoyoung</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>Seungah Helen Lee</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>-Reference<br>Kim Chung Ran, “A Little Bit Sandy but Moving Relationships with Things: On an Anxiety from Prudence and Love; Chung Seo Young’s Sculptures,” <em>Chung Seo Young</em> by Kumho Gallery (1995), Kumho Gallery, Seoul, Korea.<br>Kim Hyunjin, 'Things and languages that shine and vibrate on their own,' <em>Art in Culture</em>, January 2008.<br>Jang Ji-han ed., <em>That, There, then: Writing and Drawing of Kim Beom and Chung Seoyoung</em> (Mediabus, 2021).<br>Chung Seoyoung, Interview with Barakat Contemporary, Barakat Contemporary, June 10, 2020.<br>Chung Seoyoung, “(A) Study on the Sculpture Works by Means of Siding with and Projection on Things” (Master’s Dissertation, Seoul National University, 1989).<br>Hong Soonmyeong, “Coexistence of thoroughness and laxity,' <em>Monthly Art</em>, November 1999.<br>Ms. C, “An Interview with Chung Seoyoung by Ms.C,” <em>The Speed of the Large the Small and the Wide</em>, (Hyunsil Books, 2013).<br><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220829132214_7986d3b64303401e86830ea378c07313_69fe821839314f49bc558009fe6b2ec6,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1080199,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

It is written with words from this exhibition, <em>Scoring the Words</em>. These words are either excerpted from works on display or rephrased from artist’s words on the works. The poem connotes the temporal background of each work; it depicts a world in which different contexts, and their space and time, intersect. Both your intimate emotions and the social environment around you shape the reading of this poem. They might also evoke some scenes or sentiments that resonate with all of us. The nuanced emotions and varied deliberations, both nested in the poetic words, expand our thinking. They further generate collective (un)consciousness, senses, and vitality.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><em>Scoring the Words</em> reflects on ‘poetry’, SeMA’s exhibition agenda in 2022. Itself a piece of poetry, the exhibition proposes to perceive artistic practice as a set of poetic language that gives rise to the common imagery, or the affect. It also looks at ‘Asia’ as a field of discourse and expression where the language generated by the artistic practice undulates. Bringing together layers of creative practices that are either grounded in or hovering around Asia into the poetic form, the exhibition thus becomes at once a song for a collective and a language of resilience. Furthermore, through the works of the practitioners &ndash; all of whom have observed and articulated the political, social, and cultural movements in Asia that have unfolded synchronously &ndash; it questions how the collective consciousness and sensibilities congeal and emerge.&nbsp;</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>With fourteen artists, curators, researchers, and musicians, the exhibition does not intend to define a singular regional identity or represent contemporary phenomena as a theme. Rather, it examines the differences between each movement &ndash; particularly those of local experiences and characteristics &ndash; and questions whether there are particular thoughts and reflections that could be deemed ‘the Asian’. The artistic practices featured in the exhibition pierce through the remnants of history in Asia, including those of colonialism, dictatorship, and developmentalism. They turn these traces into images and signs; they return to us as a language that captures and fights against the underlying contemporary tensions. This language further catalyzes the sense of reality and the common imagery. It renders the modes and methods of collective movements into metaphors, while even conspiring temporary attempts at collectivity. Such movements are based on the state of being ‘connected’ and ‘together’: each of their manifestations will cross borders, prop each other up, and allow us to discover the meaning of the ‘individual’ and the ‘collective’ anew.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>Furthermore, the exhibition offers itself to be the site of events as a testing ground for practices that can shape reality through a language of affect. <em>Access Points</em>, for instance, is both a site and a series of public programs that experiments with the possibility of ‘connection’ and ‘contact’. A wide variety of actions and events invite the participants to experience a sense of being together and connected. Here, what emerges is a kind of community, which is less a representation of communal solidarity than a series of simultaneous encounters and reflections. Upon being written, read, and shared, poetry becomes a song. It then turns into a language that connects the nodes of mass consciousness. As such, it is hoped that <em>Scoring the Words</em>, through experiences grounded in the senses and emotions, sparks the sensibility of the ‘common’ albeit for a moment. Through it, we might be able to ask ourselves once again what it means to be together, or what it means to strive for the common.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220808175717_f99b643cd87849d7b36b398554f6aa06_56e07f0cdd2c4664b356d25371630b1b,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1073846,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

In order to protect the present consciousness, the unconsciousness selectively excludes negative memories. Family albums demonstrate this tendency clearly since people only allow photographs depicting happy moments to be included in them. However, we cannot deny that the disqualified past also resides deep inside and forms the invisible foundation of our mind. The project <em>Permanent Vacation</em> examines the invisible unconsciousness by concealing parts of a photograph when the original function of the medium is to visually represent what is seen.</p><p><br></p><p>In <em>Permanent Vacation</em>, Ahn focuses on two recurring elements in family albums: ‘smile’ and ‘stand up straight’. In <em>Permanent Smiles&nbsp;</em>(2022), the stereotypical smiles prevalent in family albums are isolated by covering soil, horizontally from the left to the right edge of the original photographs, vertically right above and below the smiling lips, consequently creating images in the shape of a long narrow window. Anonymous smiles are separated from their original context and start to seem vacuous as the original intentions and purposes of the occasion represented in the photographic image are unknown. The sense of helplessness of isolated smiles within enlarged photographic prints is amplified by the quietude of the exhibition space. In <em>Permanent Legs&nbsp;</em>(2022), ‘stand up straight’ family photographs are mounted on aluminum plates and carefully inserted into finely cut wooden bars. Presented upside down so that the starting point of the legs follow the line of the horizon, thereby creating an optical illusion that makes it appear as if the legs are cut off inversely.</p><p><br></p><p>The function of family album lies in extending the life of the past by sustaining visual memories. Ahn’s photographic amputation ultimately creates ‘dead photographs’ by ending the life of the past. The family photographs are deprived of their original purpose, that is the longevity of memories, when their context is interrupted. Eventually the photographs are allowed to leave for ‘Permanent Vacation.’</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220824184222_a83596f781df4e54b8b3356f48b45269_33463f9e3a7a4d7e858903c6cbb867de,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1079388,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Here, “poetic” signifies the attributes of poetry that traverse in and out of the literary genre. Poetry generally begins with a new perception, and an approach that puts a break on our automatic, conventional way of thinking, rendering an “unfamiliar” experiences of known subjects. The impetus for this exhibition came from the realization that the characteristics of poetry are often compared to those of art. Poetry has always been an infinite source of creative inspiration for artists. It is not easy to find a simple answer to an epistemological question like “what is poetry?” or “what does poetic mean?” Such concepts are expanding, transforming and reconstituting as flexibly and frequently as is contemporary art. This exhibition displays some of the 5,654 works gathered in the art museum's current collection, examining the various forms and developments of art and exploring the similar and disparate characteristics between poetry and art. The exhibition focuses on the elements of the speaker, the confessional personality, and the linguistic aspects that are unique to poetry, and is composed of three sections: <em>The Speaker</em>, <em>(Record of) Confession</em>, and <em>Poetry and Art</em>.</p><p><br></p><p><em>The Speaker</em> sheds light on the one who speaks. In poetry, a manifestation of words, there is always the speaker, who may or may not be the poet himself or herself. The poet sometimes conceals themselves, introducing a substitute or persona to represent their voice. In the same way, an artist may present themselves directly in their work but can also speak through new figures of their creation. The presence of the speaker can not only be erased or transformed at times within the stage the artist has constructed, but the speaker can also take a non-human form or many forms for that matter. The poet turns their image into a poetic subject and draws an analogy to painting, as exemplified in the famous Yoon Dong-ju poem <em>Self-Portrait</em>, and many other poems that are composed under the title “self-portrait.”</p><p><br></p><p><em>(Record of) Confession</em> explores the introspective, sometimes confessional, nature of poetry. One of the multiple reasons that many people can identify themselves with poetry is because it shares the poet’s inner experiences and emotions with the listener/reader. The process leading up to the confession is never easy, because the speaker must constantly confront memories of the past, recognize the present, and go through a process of reflection and purification. The ways in which the artist reveals oneself and conveys their personal experiences and thoughts to the audience are still effective and meaningful in the realm of art. The exhibited works explore the subjects of love and identity, and communicate with the audience by revealing the artists’ attitude and experience of life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, <em>Poetry and Art</em> approaches the linguistic and structural aspects of poetry, and looks at visual language within art works from multiple angles. The language of poetry conveys a sense of “ambiguity” in that a poem can be interpreted in multiple ways, and paradoxically, this comes from the fact that the language of poetry is very specific. Similarly, the formative elements used by artists take on individual specificity, but they aim for implied meaning, sometimes going against logic and making poetic leaps. The common features of poetry, such as metaphor, symbolism, allegory, rhythm, poetic imagination and lyricism are also elements often found in works of art. Experimenting with the possibilities and limitations of visual art, artists articulate their own formative language in the exhibited works, which is sometimes not easy to decode or causes various semantic effects.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibited works are organized under separate categories but are not segmented, because narratives are articulated through the borrowed lips of the speaker, and the way it is done is often unveiled under ambiguous or metaphorical visual language. The boundaries and categories in art are becoming gradually vague today, and different disciplines overlap and interact with each other, making crossovers and exchanges. SeMA hopes that this exhibition will shed new light on contemporary art and poetry, and offer an opportunity to rediscover and reinvent the meaning of the displayed works.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220305195938_8fec2e1b3f0b4bcd8a4c7dc6d20f2752_d40461f4fabc494a88d5ea0f4285ec42,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1008924,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

In the collection process, he garnered images by wandering, which are stored on the web and hard drives as pictures. Then, they are integrated with the artist’s distant memories and the sense of alienation, weaving a tight web of the union on the canvas. <em>Image Union</em> presents paintings that capture the moment union arises from such a network of images. Jungin Kim's images, introduced as individuals of society, possess an active quality that occupies the canvas to overcome or overthrow the ruling system. At the same time, they propose audience to resist subordination. This encourages a ‘resistance mechanism’ against the constantly changing domination mechanism. <em>Image Union</em> presents about 20 paintings by Jungin Kim.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Attributed to his tendency of being slow to warm up to new things, Jungin Kim collects objects used far past their retirement, places a sense of alienation, and crushed trees in photographs, then mixes them with blurred memories to build a network of relationships between images.

The works installed in various directions are sometimes connected to the horizontal axis shelf, sometimes to the vertical axis, and interact with the light coming in from the ceiling or extend to the structure on the ceiling to create miscellaneous spatial scenes. In particular, the installation allows viewers to embrace a side of the structure in alignment with various viewpoints, thereby keeping them fully engaged. This venue enables viewers to approach the digital drawing, the shelf on which it is placed, and the space to experience the message conveyed by the artwork.

The imagination of terror and despair that there would be no more development in individuals, society, and humanity as a whole seems to be hanging over the daily lives of modern people. The bleak prospects represented by the term are expressed through a pessimistic depiction of individuals harshly oppressed, and their society strictly controlled. Dystopia is a narrative of the joy and doubt about technical development, passion for the near future, aspiration toward freedom and its loss, and great catastrophe interlocked with destructive desire. It seems to be a keyword containing the disruptive desire existing in the origin of humanity in the context of revelation.</span></p><p><span style='font-family:맑은 고딕;'>ㅤ</span></p><p><span style='font-family:맑은 고딕;'>That is why the myth of Dystopia manifests itself as a blind faith. The form of dystopia, which takes apocalypse as security, acquires a sense of reality as if it has “already been with us” in the present.

Social issues and problems reveal themselves through the media while their producers often summon them as tools. The afterimages of the split media have infiltrated deep into our daily lives while all those ideologies and narratives have been broken into pieces.

From the beginning, convergence to 1 was not our interest. For us, 1 is the conventional way of exhibition organized under a specific theme. When the artists and the curators started discussing this exhibition, it was easy to reach an agreement that we do not need to repeat the exhibition if it was to be held in the conventional way. Then, what could this exhibition be? By putting you in the place of the subject and putting me in the place of the object, we can start this exhibition. The title, Tu m’, is the compression of our attitude towards this exhibition. We have been knowing each other as long as 20 years or as short as two to three years. We have believed in each other and encouraged every course of artistic efforts. Finding an answer to art and contemporary art was left to the duty of each individual. Putting ourself in the subject of creation, we thought that this path was lonely and painful. Each one of us was impatient and longs for recognition and understanding. But it’s weird. Everyone has been yearning for the same thing, but why is this road still dark as if it is underground? Then, we ask each other a simple question, ‘so, what have you done?’.</p><p>Starting from you once again, we learn many things while trying to understand each other. In this attempt, empathy is demanded. We take time to think about each other while thinking about each other’s work. Hanul Gwak transforms Seungbeom Son’s attitude of Yeom (earnest wish,&nbsp;念) into flowers. He meets Choulgue Jung, who sews his drawing on fabric, to do needlework together as grabbing his needle and hands it over back and forth on a cloth in between. To accept the errors involved with the process of understanding, he collaborates with his old friend, Wonjin Kim. At this point, the time difference between the relationships is inevitable. Wonjin Kim is aware of this difference and records the process of sewing performed by everyone who participated in Hanul Gwak and Choulgue Jung’s sewing, and names the video&nbsp;〈Promenade〉. Wonjin Kim wants to meet agreement with Seungbeom Son in the perspective of art, but &lt;Eye to Eye&gt; rather resembles a splendid encounter mixing with understanding and misunderstanding than approaching consensus of opinions.</p><p>If Hanul Gwak and Wonjin Kim take the pulling and pushing process while facing each other, Seungbeom Son and Choulgue Jung draw a circle. Choulgue Jung believes that love is close to unrequited love. When love is one-sided and not returned, the emotion for loving someone can be more vigorous. As we hope to be recognized by you in moments of attraction, we go through every word, action, and trace of you. Those things are stolen and put in some boxes. In this exhibition, audiences can open the boxes one by one and listen to his story, which is similar to their own unrequited love. Seungbeom Son collects things leftover, which seems to be hard to throw away, from the studios of other artists, and transforms them into monuments. The leftover things after making something in the process of creation, end up with disposal. Seungbeom Son, who does not move his steps out of this unavoidable cycle, collected leftover things from the studios of Hanul Gwak, Wonjin Kim, and Choulgue Jung, and revives them into new life.&nbsp;</p><p>The proper words to define such a method of creation I stated above are too scarce, so it is often referred to as collaboration. Our collaboration does not find a secured center of gravity. We attempt the possibilities of altering the name between pushing and pulling, rather than finding the balance point between us. If collaboration, in a general perspective, is something made by tentative intention at some point between the arrows come and go, the collaboration we have tried is the externalization of inquiry and the method of understanding you. Tu m’ is an experiment of forms and finds the way of revealing the process specifically in an exhibition. Although it carries out an experiment of form, the process and content are the specific responses to contemporary art for each one of us. In this experimental exhibition that consists of various attempts, we all are the emerging artists. Because the movement of arrows back and forth is not an event in the flat surface of two-dimension, it makes tangible and concrete creation that is bent, cut off, and drawn between each other. We start with four artists and two curators, but we want to meet the other and take them in the place of subject. I hope that you ( ) me to see and listen more.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220705103000_568b40c974024e4eb0d5b2a6ee240d2e_71b07184a9a848f99bd6e3efd6140fdb,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1062657,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Reflecting his longing for the garden, Othoniel chose Deoksugung Palace, adjacent to the Seoul Museum of Art, as a space to perform his magic.

Upon entering the exhibition space in the museum, the visitors are greeted with <em>La Rose du Louvre(The Rose of Louvre)</em> and the <em>Plum Blossom</em> painting series, followed by the overwhelmingly captivating work <em>Riviere bleue(Blue River)</em> made of over 7,000 blue glass bricks. 14 knot-shaped works are suspended above or placed on <em>Riviere bleue(Blue River)</em>, creating a new landscape depending on the point of view, and the <em>Precious Stonewall</em> series on the wall releases lights of splendid colors. In the end of the exhibition, <em>Agora</em> reminds us of the meaning of human connection and sharing, followed by <em>Oracle</em> which expresses a strong belief in intuition.</p><p><br></p><p>Othoniel's brilliantly shimmering works may only seem just beautiful at a glance; however, upon closer and slower reading of the works, one can find the coexistence of anxiety and suffering lying beneath such exquisiteness. The traces of glass produced through the mouth-blowing process appear to be scratches and dents when looking at each individual pearl, but they present a harmonious splendor when the numerous pearls are brought together into a necklace. Just as splendor shines brighter through wounds, life is revived in the nature of the garden, nourished by death, and the human life also fills up with hope, paradoxically through the process of suffering. By delivering the secrets, wonder and enchantment of the cosmos contained in the garden in his works, Jean-Michel Othoniel hopes for the visitors to face their own anxieties, wounds and sufferings, to dream of new aspirations to cope with the world just as he did.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Admission</strong></p><p>Seoul Museum of Art - Free Admission</p><p>Deoksugung - Adult (age 19-64) 1,000 won</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Youth (age 7-18) 500 won</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Children (under 7 years old) and&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seniors (over 65 years old) Free Admission</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220609091141_af7a31daede041d09d82519fd99e8de9_4440685e01934618869ff9e45e1a90f6,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1039732,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

In the history of art, works have been produced in line with societal and technological development. Today, the concept of production highlights art making itself, collaborations with shared objectives or industrialized modes of production. These categories do not adhere to a single concept but are discussed in various levels depending on the subject matter or medium of the work. The concept of production has been shifting according to the expansion of media and works designated to respond to curatorial presentations in exhibitions. However, modes of production that emphasize the expansive scale of work became less relevant, as the economic growth slowed down and the global pandemic caused a variety of restrictions.</p><p style='user-select: auto;'><br style='user-select: auto;'></p><p style='user-select: auto;'><em style='user-select: auto;'>Grid Island</em> imagines a form of contemporary art that transits from media to data as well as a new creative platform that can respond to this shift. The exhibition configures potentials of the world wide web, which transcend spatial and temporal limitations and enable sharing and collaboration as its framework. For this, <em style='user-select: auto;'>Grid Island</em> establishes a production platform that traverses the virtual and the real to suggest a new mode and concept of production.</p><p style='user-select: auto;'><br style='user-select: auto;'></p><p style='user-select: auto;'>SeMA Nanji Residency was founded in 2006 utilizing vacant spaces alongside landfill leachate facilities with the aim to foster emerging artists’ continuous creative practice. Year after year, its strategy developed beyond providing physical ‘space’ for creation. It also became a site for experimenting exhibition formats for the ‘product’ of their work. By means of an incubating program that centers the ‘artist,’ it expanded the definition of institutional support. Such programs gradually progressed through the condition of ‘production’ based on process and methodology. In the early 2000s, artist residencies hosted by public institutions were introduced to the South Korean scene as a model for urban regeneration and public programs making use of vacant spaces. Since the first phase, SeMA Nanji Residency operated various programs to support resident artists through exhibitions, criticism, re-education and international exchange on top of providing studios as a working base. In line with it, <em style='user-select: auto;'>Grid Island&nbsp;</em>intends to delineate the role of production, of which artist residencies have been in charge in South Korean contemporary art. The exhibition aims to deal with the keywords of ‘space,’ ‘artwork,’ ‘artist’ and ‘production’ in a non-linear way. These keywords have been focal to SeMA Nanji Residency’s programs that evolved over the past sixteen years.</p><p style='user-select: auto;'><br style='user-select: auto;'></p><p style='user-select: auto;'>Like the digital interface that arrange the data in parallel rows, the exhibited elements are not divided but spread homogeneously in the space. In this way, works operate like data and the exhibition functions as a database. The exhibition consists of three sections, each dealing with a specific node of art production. “Data Center” presents modes of collecting, editing and reproducing data with works by Ikhyun Gim and Woomin Hyun, Sungseok AHN, and Eunjoo Hong. “Data Export” transfers immaterial data to the real world as physical bodies with works by Ahram Kwon, Kim Donghee, Nicolas Pelzer, SungHong Min, Jungki Beak, Daisuke Ida x PARK Sunghwan and Jeong Jinhwa. Finally, “Metadata” scrutinizes tendencies of data production and consumption as well as media environment with works by Eunsol Lee, Eunhee Lee x Shinjae Kim and Suji Han.&nbsp;</p><p style='user-select: auto;'><br style='user-select: auto;'></p><p style='user-select: auto;'>When lines span horizontally and vertically, a set of sections are generated. We call this dense net of relations a grid. An online residency was shaped as an apparatus traversing online and offline and a new condition of production, under which multiple creators can interact on a web basis. For this, <em style='user-select: auto;'>Game-Sandbox-Residency</em> (hereafter <em style='user-select: auto;'>GSR</em>) is constructed to share data by inserting artistic media of flat works, sculpture, architecture and sound as game components for creating a ‘world.’ <em style='user-select: auto;'>GSR</em> is an online residency with participants Nicolas Pelzer, Sungseok AHN, Daisuke Ida, Eunsol Lee, Jeong Jinhwa and Suji Han. Simultaneously, it is a tool for creation and a kind of game.</p><p style='user-select: auto;'><br style='user-select: auto;'></p><p style='user-select: auto;'>Offline collaborations continue in the physical dimension as well. Ikhyun Gim and Woomin Hyun formed a rather temporary collective, yet they collected sound and image under the physical restriction and distance between South Korea and Japan, and arrayed their result in the exhibition. Together with curator Shinjae Kim, Eunhee Lee conceived her work following the methodology of video making and executed the actual production. Daisuke Ida and curator PARK Sunghwan pursued production methodology through a type of localizing strategy to overcome physical and linguistic distance between them.&nbsp;</p><p style='user-select: auto;'><br style='user-select: auto;'></p><p style='user-select: auto;'>We invite the viewers to <em style='user-select: auto;'>Grid Island</em> to contemplate how immaterial data became the realization of the virtual, which ceaselessly interacts with our reality. While the exhibition retrieves the role of artist residency, it pursues the recognitions about contemporary art environment as well as possibilities of improvements on the institutional level. We hope it will be a chance to experience the variety of production methods and the new possibility of creating through the process of sharing and collaboration.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220721170115_914459a7a672476284978aee6a5b9335_0aeeeb62844c48f0b5f1f71fc8a19fe0,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1045011,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
1035709,482,Archived Memories,,SeMA Bunker,2022-04-28,2022-06-05,,,Seoul Museum of Art,,,,,,,"<p>Archived Memories&nbsp;is an exhibition that brings together six pieces of video artworks, the results of the SeMA Bunker Archive Project which has run for five years since 2017. The SeMA Bunker Archive Project is a project by which visual artists document the Yeouido Bunker refurbished as a new art space for Seoul’s citizens through their free interpretations. This project is a video production to transform the bunker into a place to consistently host culture. The Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) commissioned artists Hyewon Kwon, Daum Kim, Kwang-ju Son, Jisun Shin, Yoon Jeewon , and LEE Jungwoo to produce video archives for the purpose of building the bunker’s identity, using the History Gallery within the SeMA Bunker as a base. After producing videos six times, each work has become an archive like a warehouse that always opens to the future.</p><p>The production of video archives about the SeMA Bunker holds those artists’ will not only to prove and represent a historical fact, but also to explore a place. The identity of the underground bunker discovered by chance during the construction of the Yeouido Bus Transfer Center in May 2005 was established through some circumstantial evidence. The bunker devoid of any fact-based records tends to have some variable identity depending on how we see its political and social background. The bunker was the ‘thing’ that was actually nonexistent in citizen life during the period of hush-up. To those artists, documenting the placeness of the bunker where reality and vacuum overlap approximates the process of redesigning an equivocal space in which exact truth and imagination are jumbled together.&nbsp;</p><p>In a conventional sense, archives cover all the documenting and listing that make specific materials available to read with ease. In other words, an archive is a system of accumulating, arranging, keeping, and managing scattered data. The six pieces on show at this exhibition are counter to the preexisting concept of archives in two respects. These works are different from the usual system of organizing data in that they capture the bunker’s vague reality. These are rather approximating information on the bunker, reflecting each artist’s perspective and artistic language respectively. At the same time, each work is seen to be an archive of the bunker couched in artistic idioms, amassed as the SeMA Bunker Archive Project. Thus they come across the viewers through the platform of Archived Memories and look forward to the advent of the next archive.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Archived Memories’ is a portrayal of five-year-long productions and their approaches. Apocryphal information on the bunker is captured in videos, crossing the boundary between record and memory. In addition, memories left out of records and elements excluded from memories are the cardinal materials for revitalized, alternative, and challenging historical descriptions in many different disciplines of the times. This exhibition thinks of the artists’ practice as an attitude to adapt flexibly to the narrative structure of the times without being bound to the social structure. That is why the more fluid memory is, the longer we can remember it in our contemporary society dominated by drastic changes and an overwhelming amount of information. The visitors who will experience the memories documented by six artists are anticipated to envisage and picture the SeMA Bunker Archive Project to come, internalizing this archival sensation.&nbsp;</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220516090304_79b39d51ca0844f69ec26478e5f40220_311763db1c4349c5a480107dc8c4fbda,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1035709,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

A wide range of works were donated, including sculptures, clay models, reliefs, drawings, and oil paintings.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>While the collection includes works from years spanning between the 1950s and 1970s, it is particularly meaningful due to a significant portion of it coming from the 1950s. To honor the wishes of the Commemoration Foundation and the Kwon family, and to celebrate the centennial anniversary of Kwon’s birth, SeMA presents the retrospective exhibition <em>Angel of Atelier</em>.</p><p><br></p><p>The title of the exhibition <em>Angel of Atelier</em> is borrowed from Kwon’s poem featured in <em>Chosun Ilbo Daily</em> on 3 March 1972, “Artistic reflections: Spring, singing of Spring while creating Angel of Atelier.” Laced with defiantly tragic undertones, the poem is charged with Kwon’s attitude toward his work, subjects, methods, pursuits, life regrets, and even faint hopes.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>An excerpt from his poem reads, “When covered with clay and fired, someone repents and is sublimated as an angel for whose existence I yearn.” Such “angel of atelier” Kwon mentioned likely refers to the pure ideals he sought to achieve in his works.</p><p><br></p><p>Tracing Kwon’s “artistic reflections” to find his “Angel of Atelier,” this exhibition goes back to his beginnings as an artist when Kwon joined the Seongbuk Painting Research Institute (1946 &ndash; 1950) in 1947.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The exhibition also covers works since this period all the way until his death in May 1973.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Based on Kwon’s poem and his lifelong commitment to Buddhism, the exhibition is organized into distinct periods of his life grouped as <em>Wander forth&nbsp;</em>(1947 - 1958), <em>Self&ndash;Discipline&nbsp;</em>(1959 - 1968), and <em>State of Enlightenment&nbsp;</em>(1969- 1973). Although Kwon committed himself in art just as a Buddhist monk leaves the secular world and renounces himself in a lifelong pursuit of spirituality, he despaired over the fact that he was not able to sell his works. This led Kwon to immerse himself further in Buddhism and eventually cut ties with the world. This exhibition hopes to shed a glimpse into such life Kwon led and works he created.</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition space was designed based on the artist’s studio and his first solo exhibition held at The Press Center in 1965. Kwon’s works are displayed on large structures of cement blocks and red bricks which resemble a well and a kiln, situated on either sides of the exhibition space. Photographs of Kwon’s first solo exhibition indicate that his works were displayed on cement blocks and red bricks rather than on pedestals. Such method of display invites the audience to a deeper immersion into Kwon’s works, or the angels of his atelier, as they take a stroll throughout a space reflective of his studio.</p><p><br></p><p>While Kwon is generally renowned for his female busts including <em>Bust Z</em> (1967), he actually created a wide range of works including animal sculptures, female head busts and chest busts, female sculptures, self-portrait sculptures, reliefs, Buddha statues, masks, objects, roof charms, oil paintings, and drawings.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Kwon referred to himself as more of an artisan than an artist<a href='#_ftn1' name='_ftnref1' title=''></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>and placed great value in the cultural heritage of the countless nameless artisans from the past. As such, Kwon did not assign special hierarchy or order of importance between works based on the subjects or size.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Kwon persistently strove for essence beyond the visible object, and to do so, he referred to the classical legacy of eastern and western culture. Through this, Kwon manifested eternity through a robust and concentrated form that was uniquely his own. This was also the reason why Kwon chose the archaic medium of terracotta (which does not rot) and lacquer,<em>&nbsp;</em>which is distinctively resistant to decay, humidity, and insects.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The exhibition provides a site through which to closely examine Kwon’s perspective of eternity and the production processes of his terracotta and lacquer works that reflect the modernization of tradition, and hopes to enhance the viewers’ fundamental yet faithful understanding of the formation of Kwon’s unique oeuvre.</p><p><br></p><p>As Kwon proposed in his poem saying “history repeats the functional relationship of the power of truth,” the time has now come to take a fresh, unprejudiced look at his works in the contemporary art that places no constraints on ?figurative versus abstract art, materials, or technique.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>We would like to express our deep gratitude to the KWON JINKYU FOUNDATION, the bereaved family, all organizations, and the private collectors who have supported this exhibition through loans.</p><p><br>Gana Foundation for Arts and Culture / KOREA UNIVERSITY MUSEUM / National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea / KWON JINKYU FOUNDATION / Kumsaem Foundation / SAMSUNG FOUNDATION OF CULTURE / Hansol Cultural Foundation / PKM Gallery</p><p><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220421140005_ebd71af6164442baa453c333a5619419_df1caae8c1904161820f203966721c57,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1033195,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

He is also a sculptor forming bonding with wide-ranging objects he collected in life, and having them reborn as artworks through his literary imagination. The Nam-Seoul Museum of Art &nbsp;presents an exhibition titled <em>Sung Chankyung in Cheonggeumru&nbsp;</em>to shed light on Sung’s oeuvre based on “poetry” as a conceptual and narrative frame to crisscross various art genres. The exhibition is also intended to reveal that material things or objects are to be cherished as precious beings beyond their usage to the point of enriching our psychological and materialistic life through Sung’s artistic creation and daily life, and offer food for thought to those living in today’s world.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This exhibition consists of five parts. &nbsp;<em>Cheonggeumru-A Study of the Artist&nbsp;</em>exhibits a reproduced work of his study Cheonggeumru as his microcosm who studied and produced art there. Showcased also are related materials and works to hint at his major poetry theory with his early poetry, ecological poetry, material right poetry and dense-core poetry. <em>&nbsp;Dialogue with Yao Yi-Wei: Words + Art</em>&nbsp; presents a video on “Mal-yesul” performed by Sung along with archives. While &nbsp;<em>Pleasantly Prayed_Material Things and Their Right</em> presents sculptures made of discarded objects imbued with a new life, &nbsp;<em>Au-Aurora: Rhythm of the World</em> shows his poem written in the Universe Rhythm, which he coined as a rhythm for the dense-core poetry, his object work and drawing, and props made more precious thanks to their miniature size. Lastly, &nbsp;<em>Mentors Who Give Me Wisdom: Sung Chankyung’s Ode to Them</em> is filled up with objects and his poetry to honor his mentors in various fields that were the source of inspiration for Sung and his art.</p><p><br></p><p>This exhibition will serve as a catalyst to shed light on Sung’s pioneering activities as a multi-genre artist linking literature with figurative and performance arts, and examine his visionary talent as an artist that could predict what would top the agenda in the future &ndash; environment, economy and society-even in the 60s and 70s in the forms of poetry and sculptural art. His respect for the “right of material things” he acted out would resonate through the hearts of the emotionally void in the modern world despite endless consumption, while mirroring back the current era of instability where the ecological environment is worthy of severe attention.&nbsp;</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220315100547_a09c6b615aa54698bef222cf7288c28c_c72a7db0c285483c97a6f3fe9ed5ad75,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=1012724,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

847104,477,sanghee song's solo exhibition Homo Natura,,Seosomun Main Branch,2021-12-16,2022-02-27,,,,,,,,,,"<p><em>Homo Natura</em> is a solo exhibition of the media artist sanghee song (b.1970). The exhibition presents six new works commissioned by the Seoul Museum of Art, along with a work that has not yet been shown in Korea. The artist embraces various forms of media and builds her own visual language that unfolds contradictions of modern society inside a delicate narrative structure. The artist collects and studies various forms of literature such as myths, media reports, and historical records, and visits sites where these past traces remain. Based on the research, she has carried out aesthetic experiments that fuse different genres such as music, drawing, and literature into video works. Each reference has been woven into horizontally dense creative narratives, suggesting open endings, and they gradually expand into larger narratives throughout her oeuvre. In an era of media convergence, how the artist builds her narratives intersect with a method of <em>transmedia storytelling</em>, wherein a narrative becomes more creatively enriched when it is divided and unfolds and is re-integrated again through various platforms.<a href='#_ftn1' name='_ftnref1' title=''>[1]</a> Furthermore, the artist can be regarded as a digital<em>&nbsp;quiltmaker</em>; her art practice is reminiscent of the process of overlaying colorful pieces of fabric sans hierarchy or a careful sewing which sublimates them into handicrafts with unique patterns and beauty.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For the past 20 years, sanghee song's body of work, which has examined the origin of the dark sides of life through literary research and field exploration, has encountered several turning points. Her early interest in various women's images in Korea soon extended towards other aspects of society, the nation state, and even the larger world to which they belong, illuminating the life alienated from social conventions, hierarchies, wars, colonial views, and capitalism. The artist, who has engaged with the voices of forgotten beings, brings up the topic of <em>homo natura</em> and carefully, yet actively, tries to initiate a conversation. The title of this exhibition is a quote from <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> by Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche criticized the absolute dualism represented by the notion of good and evil, and said “the terrible basic text of <em>homo natura</em> must be recognized even underneath these fawning colors and painted surfaces.”<a href='#_ftn2' name='_ftnref2' title=''>[2]</a></p><p><br></p><p>Since some time ago, we often witness contradictions that our society does not try to understand each other, but only pushes personal stance further through coercion and sophistry. For those of us, humans, subjected to the world of infinite competition called neoliberalism, standards such as good and evil, sameness and difference, truth and falsehood seem clear at first glance, but in reality, an individual's multifaceted human nature is intertwined in complex and subtle situations. <em>Homo Natura&nbsp;</em>is organized to reflect on humans by returning to this “terrible basic text,” in order to gain clues for our coexistence. At the same time, the exhibit leads the audience to glimpse the artist's new attempt to form a mutual relationship with participants by presenting delicate drawings and objects, along with various filming devices and media. This imparts an artistic message that transcends the boundaries of media and provides an opportunity for viewers for active communication.</p><p><br></p><p><a href='#_ftnref1' name='_ftn1' title=''>[1]</a> Jae Hyun Lee, “Chapter 7.

Instead of looking through a rigid thematic lens, it invites a dynamic understanding of Australian art and society with complex cultural, social, and political threads.

Fostering self-reflection and critical thinking, the project ultimately welcomes an unfixing of what we had previously considered known, or unknown.

846980,475,Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,,Nam-Seoul Museum of Art,2021-11-30,2022-02-27,,,,[Weekdays(Tue-Fri)] 10AM~8PM [Sat?Sun?Holiday] 10AM~6PM  [Closed Days] Every Monday,,"Painting, Installation, Video, Performance, etc",,"Chung Heemin, Jung Myungwoo, Jung Jihyun, Parc Rahm",,"<p><em>Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</em> at the Nam-Seoul Museum of Art explores the experience of today’s art production involved in the creative handling of materials and technologies.<br>These days, the smart devices we carry around with us all day have blurred the boundaries between technology and the body in many ways. The messages we frequently exchange with other people and the algorithms created based on our previous search history not only help us save time but offer us convenience. But, they also work in the other way to keep us under the control of such digital technologies. In that virtually everything is searchable and most data of the past can be reloaded when need be, there is no doubt that human beings became still more ‘smarter.’ Nevertheless, it is also true that our right and liberty of choice or a certain initiative concerning such a process have been transferred to the technologies in question, while we remain in the dark about the logic of its design and programming. In addition, the means of communicating with the world using smart devices are reduced to two fingers, the thumb and index finger. The immense diversity of our thoughts and desires is transmitted via the single sense of touch(touching screens). This phenomenon therefore takes us to the era of touch with no trace of sensuality. However, the ways in which we perceive the world can never be unified. For this reason, although with all the possibility of connecting with everyone in everywhere and seeing more things, we sometimes have the feeling of emptiness and boredom in front of the sleek surface of the screen.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</em> takes its cue from the emerging concerns about the side/reverse effects of the remote experiences of art, which is gaining momentum along with the imposition of pandemic regulations. It came as a great relief to the art community that we still can accommodate the audience beyond the virus’s reach even in the era of the pandemic by means of the virtual exhibition formats. At the same time, we also need to realize the limitations of digital media, as they ‘vaporize’ the actuality of sensual experiences in the physical space of the real museum. Then, what can be the new environmental setting required for us in the field of technologies that the digital media, which can no longer be set aside or removed from our lives, has changed? As an attempt to overcome the negative effects of the digital virtual system that nullifies both our sensual experiences and art’s materiality, this exhibition examines the meaning of production through our body and sentiments in a larger context.</p><p><br></p><p>In this light, to this exhibition we invite four artists who create art seeking out beneficial relationships with matters and technologies. Before working on the mediums of sculpture, painting, installation and performance, they simulate ideas in the digital setting with software programs like SketchUp, 3D Scanning, etc. And then employing various senses, they materialize the work. The Museum asked them to consider our exhibition hall to be an actual-cum-virtual space, or where the two are overlapped. In it, they were required to view production as a process of having a contact with objects making use of both the sensory system of the body and technologies. As a result, Jung Jihyun studies materials and tries sculpture in the virtual reality. Chung Heemin sets a virtual mode of ‘meditation’ and expresses the extreme sensual experience by means of mediums. Parc Rahm brings up memories imprinted in our body and mind by the uses of smart devices and provides the viewer with an opportunity of imaginative drawing. Jung Myungwoo gathers data from physical movements and creates a performance in relation to them. With the four artists, we would like to find a way for human senses to be effective in today's changing technological environment.</p><p><br></p><p>This exhibition takes its title, Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, from that of art critic Choi Jongchul’s essay.* In the essay, Choi sees Rosalind Krauss’s view on digital media as two-fold, writing that Krauss not merely criticizes ‘the bomb(digital media)-dropping’ and its destructive influence on human senses but also expresses important hopes and expectations for it as a rescuer. Based on Krauss’s critical judgment and faith in digital media, this exhibition neither affirms nor denies the digital environment, but perceives it as a new setting for art. The exhibition intends to talk about art production in the digital world as a method of restoring<br>human senses. We believe that if we can get hold of the physical knowledge of feeling, touching and transforming the materials and technologies constituting the world, always in dialog with its changing environment, the moment of adventure based on belief in the real rather than fear will come to lead us.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout history, a new technology has always appeared. At each moment, human beings have taken a certain distance from the unfamiliar novelty, either by raising our guard against it or looking up to it. At the end of the day, whether a technology would destroy or develop our life has always been dependent on both of our hands. So I would say, it is time to stop worrying and love the bomb.</p><p><br></p><p><span style='font-size: 11px;'>*Choi Jongchul, “Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb: Media Art after Digital Seen through the Theory of Post Medium,” The Journal of Aesthetics and Science of Art, vol. 53 (2018, 02); In fact, it was in Stanley Kubrick’s film <em>Dr. Strange Love or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&nbsp;</em>(1964) that the phrase in question first appeared. The film shows the tragic outcome of atomic bomb dropping. Art Critic Rosalind Krauss borrows this title in a chapter of her book <em>Under Blue Cup</em> (2011). Choi, in order to mediate Krauss’s post-medium theory and those of other digital theorists, uses the title with a twist for his thesis.</span></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220119165909_65ff18851e1840e8b8f1ae9a4e40c8c6_9d436e5ba61f44e38c069e1bb4b683bd,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=846980,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

In the story, a girl called “Long Journey” takes the reader to a long trip. It features many familiar characters such as wolf, lion, witch, hunter and shepherd boy, and clearly refers to famous bedtime stories. Yet instead of re-writing these well-known tales with the typical “happily ever after” ending, Yee borrows their structure to propose a kind of detour through which the reader could think beyond the limitations of body, mind, norms and values. This roundabout trip may help us better understand others and change the world. Nowadays, many kids are more accustomed to playing games and watching films than reading books. For them Yeesookyung’s multiple universes will serve as an apparatus to regenerate their imaginative faculty. We hope that with the experience of and inspirations from Yeesookyung’s world of art, children can find stories of their own making.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220124091617_2ea81afc61884f1c8e1f6a6c60370860_e20f531a81a543dbb3fec80fbfcd0c8d,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=645088,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
638057,473,Your Holiday,2021 Telepicnic Project,Buk-Seoul Museum of Art,2021-09-14,2021-11-14,,,"Seoul Museum of Art, Rebel9",,,,,"Nayoungim & Gregory Maass, Nancy Baker Cahill, Timur Si-Qin",,"<p><strong>Your Holiday</strong></p><p><em>Your Holiday&nbsp;</em>is an exhibition exploring the new reality that extends, connects, and shares aesthetic experiences in contemporary art on the basis of XR (eXtended Reality). With the development of technology, we are on our way to realizing platforms that converge art and science. Such platforms comprehensively apprehend the complex cultural and artistic experiences of visitors based on the characteristics of new artistic practices. Since July 2020, the Seoul Museum of Art has been conducting the Telepicnic Project, a joint research and creation project involving extended reality with Rebel9 and Sogang University’s Research &amp; Business Development Foundation. <em>Your Holiday</em> presents the outcome of the project in the form of an exhibition with contemporary artists Nayoungim &amp; Gregory Maass, Nancy Baker Cahill, and Timur Si-Qin to build and experiment with a platform that further expands the interaction between the art scene and the virtual world. In particular, Rebel9 presents an extended reality platform <em>Mighty Verse&nbsp;</em>in collaboration with Nayoungim &amp; Gregory Maass. The platform offers an opportunity to connect the real and the virtual, sharing and accumulating experiences taking place within the connected space. The exhibition envisions new connections within the world of extended reality. It seeks to evolve relationships rather than mere advance of technologies, imagining the museum to arrive in the coming years. There, within the extended reality, the exhibition seeks to facilitate the museum and its visitors to share the vision of extended reality, explore the possibilities of technology, and prepare a new cultural and artistic ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Your Holiday&nbsp;</em>offers an opportunity to look back at reality through two words that have been faded in their meaning in the unreal world of ongoing pandemic&ndash;a personal pronoun ‘you’ and a conceptual word ‘holiday.’ In situations where ‘my’ life of security and safety is guaranteed by securing distance from ‘you,’ we have no choice but to rethink the meaning of others. In addition, the meaning of ‘holiday,’ which had been faded within our irrecoverable ‘everyday life,’ is actually an element that supports the grandiose capitalist world. It namely survives through hope that is absent. The exhibition explores the possibility of subjectivity that is free from the relationship with others against the background of the capitalist meaning and limitations within the concept of holiday. In the exhibition, holiday appears as a space of hospitality for the subject ‘you.’ The works crossing over the real and virtual world offer unseen thoughts, which realize hospitality by themselves and rediscover the space of ‘rest’ through the broad and keen reflections on the other side of contemporary culture. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Your Holiday, You Are Holiday</strong></p><p><em>Your Holiday&nbsp;</em>explores new aesthetic experiences through extended reality. It seeks to ask what we achieve and where we are heading through technological advancement. When we dream of a ‘better future’ brought by technology, we can face the coming years more actively by reflecting on how it would change our lives and to which part of ourselves it would contribute. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution advances toward an era of hyperconnectivity and superintelligence by reshaping the world order, many people can now enjoy leisure with enhanced quality with more time available. Accordingly, taking good rest in an appropriate manner has become an essential process and goal of life for the contemporaries above all else. This exhibition observes that our freedom can be indefinitely reduced when rest operates as a product of the capitalist system. In an era where capitalism has even eroded our way of life and the horizons of thinking, we constantly save time to do more and create more meanings in order to live a successful life or enjoy a happier life. Here, holidays act as temporary spaces to work better and as a middle ground to create more abundant meanings. While capitalism consolidates and expands itself, holidays become a means to realize ‘a brief recharge for more efficient results.’ Ultimately, we keep ourselves going only on the basis of continuity and efficiency within the irony of being chased by time for the sake of securing holidays. Today, the connotation of the word ‘holiday’ or ‘rest’ is omitted with ‘as much as capital allows.’&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It is undoubtedly not easy to restore the reduced freedom by escaping from rest under the enslavement of the capitalist system. Nevertheless, freedom begins with the suspension of the inherent capitalist mechanism within rest. In other words, the possibility of freedom lies in the very Act of suspending the subordination to capital and the attached meanings for the sake of holidays not operating as a means for continuity and efficiency anymore. This epitomizes the very ontology of the holiday that this exhibition intends to deliver. Rest is not a leap for moving forward, nor a space filled with meanings to bridge the past and the future. Rest is just an empty space. We cannot possess this ontological space. We can only glimpse the possibility of being a liberated subject by becoming the very space by ourselves. Therefore, this exhibition is not about possessing holidays but becoming them and restoring a being that has been lost in possession. And as a specific way to exercise such topics, the exhibition proposes a space of hospitality within the ‘Unseen Museum.’&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The artworks presented in different spaces inside and outside the Buk-Seoul Museum of Art respectively contain the form and content of hospitality in their concrete contexts. Nayoungim &amp; Gregory Maass presents a space that realizes double hospitality through the relationship between different artworks and with the extended reality platform <em>Mighty Verse</em>. <em>Miss Shrimp</em> and <em>Mighty Mama</em> are large statues inside and outside the exhibition space. The two artworks are derived from a scene in the history of art and respectively welcome the visitors in the lobby and the exhibition space. They deal with the possibility of reversal between the host and the guest, you and I. In addition, the complex installations of <em>Luncheon on the Grass</em> welcome the immaterial interventions that transform, combine, and reconstruct them on the screens of tablet computers. In other words, the artworks in the real world become a space of hospitality that is open to the intervention of the virtual world through the touch of their viewers in <em>Mighty Verse AR</em>. On the other hand, <em>Mighty Verse VR&nbsp;</em>transforms the real space into a virtual space, functioning as a storage that provides space for virtual objects created by visitors and accumulates them in one place. &nbsp;The reversible structure between the host and the guest is expanded into the relationship between the inside out outside and that of the museum and its visitors. This is realized through the XR artworks presented in the space Heart Tank?which transforms the idle space of the museum building into an exhibition space? and the outside of the museum. Timur Si-Qin’s <em>A</em> <em>New Protocol VR&nbsp;</em>redefines our spirituality within the relationship with the ‘universe of pattern, matter, and energy,’ claiming to welcome the coming years and the planet on which we live. Nancy Baker Cahill’s AR work <em>Legacy&nbsp;</em>tells a story of a coming community through a formative language by reflecting on the side effect of development and environmental issues, which is materialized as a figure of a tree. The work is designed to be viewed 24 hours a day without entering the museum from all directions. As such, it embodies the museum without borders, which is another name for the unseen museum.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The ‘extended reality of your holiday’ is a place for connecting with others, sharing experiences, and practicing new realities. At the same time, it is another social commons where we will discover that our lives on concrete and sensuous reality share another reality that is invisible to us. Through this, the exhibition reflects on the being of others that becomes stronger within the coming time and explores the possibility of rest that we can discover once again. The basis of the reflection and exploration are the strengths and limitations of our present reality. The space of art that the artworks reveal is a place to recover the empty space embedded in holidays. Whether it is visible or not, art by itself becomes rest and presents us with the possibility of free Act. Therefore, reclaiming lost holidays is possible in the space of hospitality that welcomes you. You are the holiday.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span style='font-size: 18px;'><strong class=''>* Exhibition Website</strong>: <a href='http://yourholiday.xyz'>yourholiday.xyz</a></span></p><p><span style='font-size: 18px;'><br></span></p><p><span style='font-size: 18px;'><strong>* The Telepicnic Project</strong></span></p><p><span style='font-size: 18px;'>The Telepicnic Project is a result of collaboration between the Seoul Museum of Art, Rebel9, and Sogang University’s Research &amp; Business Development Foundation.

586102,465,SF2021: A Fantasy Odyssey,,Buk-Seoul Museum of Art,2021-03-23,2021-06-06,http://www.fantasy-odyssey.com/,,Seoul Museum of Art,,,,,"Hyunseong Goo, Bo-young Kim, Heecheon Kim, Djuna, Ram Han, RHOMBVS Yorm Han, Lucy McRae, Myung-hoon Bae, Ann Lislegaard, Yangachi, Seo Young Chang, Jongwan Jang, Soyeon Jeong, Yun Choi",,"<p><em>SF2021: A Fantasy Odyssey</em> introduces contemporary art practices seeking the possibility of new thinking against the backdrop of the expansive spectrum of science fiction narratives.</p><p><br>In this moment of time, we are at a point where the futures depicted in the historically important science fiction novels are becoming a reality one after another. In fact, how accurately these ‘ancient futures’ have predicted the present reality is not of much importance. Whatever has been anticipated, we are actually living in the world they imagined &ndash; from climate change and artificial intelligence to self-driving vehicles. With this in mind, the exhibition explores the chaotic world and virtual reality in the era of the pandemic through a newly-created worldview based on the artistic presentation of science fictional imagination, to connect the future brought about in the present. To this end, the exhibition defines the notion of science fiction with a focus on the temporality of the genre:<em>&nbsp;‘Something that already exists but has not yet arrived’ or ‘something that should be told in the form of fantasy as it exists as unarrived future despite already being in the present.’</em> Therefore, the exhibition considers ‘fantasy’ as a ‘possible condition’ that builds reality, independent of its ‘content’ &ndash; such as its value as a binary opposition of science fiction or material for genre diversity. In this sense, in this exhibition, fantasy functions as a code to interpret science fiction and construct the structure of the exhibition. As with contemporary art, science fiction can be seen a kind of fantasy that reveals things that cannot be represented in simple terms. Then, it is possible to consider that science fiction can be a useful window to show that reality is already a fantasy. Hence, the current exhibition looks at science fiction through its relationship with reality, telling a story about ‘what science fiction can bring us when we create and appreciate it.’</p><p><br><em>SF2021: A Fantasy Odyssey</em> presents fourteen Korean and international artists with works in various media encompassing traditional and digital painting, experimental cartoon, photography, video, sound, installation, and text. In the works by these artists, the seemingly science fictional themes and backgrounds &ndash; the universe, time, virtual reality, dystopia, and posthuman &ndash; are presented as potential ways of new thinking that constantly renew our lives. Here, the specificity of science fiction acts as a driving force for imagining and creating a different world, offering a critical framework for observing the world. And the world in this context is one that has been ‘newly conceived based on reality.’ It is a world that preoccupies what is not in our possession, what we try to correct, and what we wish to perpetuate, as well as a place to explore the possibility of a different life, here and now. Through this world, what we can preoccupy could be, for example, the transition of our anthropocentric way of thinking, and furthermore, reflection on others. How will we coexist with constantly diversifying others in the near future when science and technology reach a magical state beyond our understanding or within the spacetime that might have already arrived where we are? How is the process of receiving new forms of posthumans and seeking different forms of existential conditions happening? The purpose of this exhibition is to reflect on reality by imagining and applying the sounds in reality &ndash; the sound created by encounters of unfamiliar beings and the one made when the future that has not arrived yet collides within the present. It is true that the historical time is infested with repetitive improvement and worsening of humanity’s problems &ndash; race, gender, disability, and poverty, among others. In this circumstance, if the world in science fiction is accelerating the clock of reality by constructing itself increasingly &ndash; hopefully toward the opposite direction of an apocalypse &ndash; the world of science fiction is then an ethical world that stubbornly tries to connect with the alienated and excluded beings in our society. Although that science fictional world is of dark ruins, there exists a will to affirm and accept life positively, which ultimately leads to our evolution.</p><p><br><em>SF2021: A Fantasy Odyssey</em> mobilizes two approaches and understandings to observe how the complex ideas in science fiction narratives are spreading across the boundaries between different media within contemporary culture and art. Firstly, the exhibition engages with ‘media experiments’ through the gallery presentation and public programs. Through the combination, intersection, and circulation of audiovisual images and texts, <em>SF2021: A Fantasy Odyssey</em> experiments the potential expansion of the genre spectrum of science fiction. As such, the exhibition begins with novels, the origin of science fiction as a literary genre. Then, it moves toward the combination of audiovisual images and texts. Four science fiction novelists propose essays that investigate the origin, essence, and present state of science fiction. The essays are then combined with audiovisual images within the exhibition, providing an overview of science fiction from within the exhibition. At the same time, the public program with participation of visitors will produce collective creation which practices ‘solidarity between words and images.’ Practiced in an experimental format that mediates collective creations through a website, the public program functions as the final site to explore the exhibition’s intent to survey the expansive possibility of thoughts dwelling on future within science fiction through media experiments. Secondly, the exhibition takes on the ‘investigation of science fictional affect.’ The science fictional imagination always returns to the present after going through the future. As such, it evokes complex emotions that are more than just a sense of wonder. Above all, it is embedded with a will to reconstruct the life of the subject who can rewrite reality. The possibility of change presented by science fiction comes from the world that is ‘newly conceived based on reality.’ Therefore, the emotions prompted by science fiction are accompanied by the infinite creative energy that affirms life. After all, the exhibition is based on the belief that the possibility of solidarity comes not from transcending reality but from building a common understanding of the world and the existence of the present.</p><p><br>As a result,<em>&nbsp;SF2021: A Fantasy Odyssey</em> intends to introduce science fiction as a tool to think anew about the world. The exhibition will open an entry point to a journey to explore a vast narrative for the future. Entering the very door leading to an ever-expanding world is like leafing through a book about humanity’s ontological reflections. With infinite stories in each chapter, the book unfolds a story about a large vessel departing toward the universe. When the audience of the exhibition boards this vessel, a voyage to explore new spacetime will begin. In this ‘exhibition about science fiction,’ the experiences and imagination of the audiences will lead to a great leap. Ultimately, it will enable an evolution toward a ‘science fictional moment’ through all things that take place here and now. Twenty years have passed since the very future depicted in the movie <em>2001: A Space Odyssey&nbsp;</em>(1968) became our present. In the movie, the spaceship took on a voyage toward the evolution of humanity. In <em>SF2021: A Fantasy Odyssey</em>, the audiences are expected to take on the science fictional moment in which a ‘fantasy odyssey’ is written and a ‘place to come’ unfolds.</p><p><br></p><p><span style='font-size: 18px;'>For further information, please contact to Kahyun Song. <a href='mailto:kahyun@seoul.go.kr'>kahyun@seoul.go.kr</a></span></p><p><span style='font-size: 18px;'><br></span></p><p><span style='font-size: 18px;'>Exhibition website: <a class='' href='http://www.fantasy-odyssey.com/' rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank'><u class=''>www.fantasy-odyssey.com</u></a></span></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2021%2F&FILE_NM=20210322235450_a7fc58d098d7471dab08811d5809aba8_d3df2e3a04a74309bc8f1f6b2f2faea8,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=586102,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

But what if we were to embrace it, turn it around, and reimagine our relationship with escapism?</p><p><br></p><p><em>One Escape at a Time</em> is inspired by ideas of escapism, especially in the context of the current popular media landscape.</p><p><br></p><p>The US sitcom <em>One Day at a Time</em> (2017?20), first produced and made available for streaming worldwide by Netflix, is a contemporary update of the 1970s sitcom of the same name. It charts the life of a three-generation Cuban American family sharing the same roof in Los Angeles. Despite its seemingly conventional format, the sitcom flips the norms of media representation and disguises its central concerns with laughter while tackling some of the most urgent and human questions today: racism, gender, class, sexuality, identity, migration, gentrification, and violence, among others.</p><p><br></p><p>Programs and other media like <em>One Day at a Time</em> that utilize escapism as a conduit for engaging or confronting sociopolitical subject matter are a key starting point for the Biennale.

It is still too soon for any of us to fully understand the pandemic’s lasting impact, but we all feel its immediate effects. Even as the isolation of millions in their own homes has brought about a mass appetite for forms of micro-escape, many people have mobilized on the streets to take a stand against racial and social injustices over the past year. In this new and confusing reality, perhaps we need to go beyond the proposition of simply embracing escapism. Rather, we can utilize it as a critical mechanism for confronting and connecting with the world we live in.</p></main></section><section><br></section></section>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2021%2F&FILE_NM=20210906175458_c69a09c688124d38a30a9142fad76bda_32943ac0f212420ab0254a5bb678dbee,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/series/detail?exNo=636293,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Our human habitat and our earth's ecology share the same etymology of oikos. Climate Museum: Life and Death of Our Home is an exhibition on the crisis of these small and large homes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Three kinds of homes comprise the thematic sections of&nbsp;Climate Museum. The first is the home for all things: the earth’s eco-system, the&nbsp;oikos&nbsp;in the midst of irrevocable disruption.&nbsp;Tragic Oikos&nbsp;houses a series of dead trees, videos, and taxidermy specimens dealing with starved animals that have lost their habitat, dying conifer forests in Mt. Halla, ocean deserts in the East Sea, melting Antarctica glaciers, and data centers, the fastest growing source of carbon emissions. The second is the human home, the modern Korean house caught in the constant cycle of building and wrecking. As 40% of the world’s carbon emissions originates from construction,&nbsp;House as Assemblage: Building-Wrecking&nbsp;focuses on the life-cycle of the Korean apartment and their materials. The third home in&nbsp;Climate Museum&nbsp;is a habitat for bees, birds, and butterflies. Independent of the exhibition, its schedule, and its visitors,&nbsp;B-Plex&nbsp;has been installed on the museum’s roof terrace for birds to hatch their eggs and raise their young in the spring and wild bees gather pollen during autumn. Though visits will be limited to protect the bees, birds, and butterflies, they can always be viewed through the CCTV and telescope in the courtyard. From these three homes -&nbsp;Tragic Oikos, House as Assemblage, and&nbsp;B-Plex -&nbsp;artists, activists, and scientists speak to the ecological crisis: desertification, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, plastics pollution, the exploitation of resources, and the destructive logic of real estate.</p><p><br></p><p>The climate crisis grows ever more serious. Hence, an exhibition on climate change, itself an inevitable consumer of energy, is both timely and uncomfortable.&nbsp;Climate Museum&nbsp;confronts this uncomfortable truth and looks at the climate crisis from the perspective of the home for art. Deploying re-used copy papers, recycled picture frames, refurbished iPads, energy efficient fonts and printing methods, the exhibition seeks any and all methods to reduce its own carbon footprint. As Covid-19 accelerates the transformation of our homes,&nbsp;Climate Museum&nbsp;asks how an exhibition might displace humans from its self-supposed center. The exhibition was at once conceived as a series of online, offline, and outdoor displays, accessible even when museum entry is restricted.</p><p><br></p><p>Climate Museum: Life and Death of Our Home was curated on the foundation of the research developed through Climate Citizen 3.5, a public art project supported by the Arts Council Korea.

Joo Jaehwan is an artist who presents humorous yet acerbic insight on the key issues in Korea’s modernity, and his son Homin is a renowned “webtoon” (online comics) creator who rose to stardom for his webtoon exploring the notion of afterlife in Korean mythology. By presenting the interplay between the distinctly different genres of the two artists, this exhibition sheds insight on how the role of artists as storytellers have evolved and manifested differently across generations.</p><p>&nbsp; In order to do so, the exhibition presents “the integration of images and text” as a common means of storytelling that the two artists employ. In turn, the exhibition examines the differences in the artists’ storytelling method present in their respectively dissimilar personalities and media of choice. In Joo Jaehwan’s works, the text serves as a poetic metaphor that prompts the viewers’ imaginations of the narrative implied in the works. On the other hand, Joo Homin’s works explicitly present text as a narrative message in the comics-like speech bubbles, providing a more cinematic experience of imagination.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Sometimes dubbed <em>homo narrans</em>, humans are instinctively driven to storytelling. According to the American scholar of comparative mythology Joseph Campbell, such incessant drive for storytelling stems from the desire to establish a relationship with the world, i.e to reconcile our lives with reality. Likewise for the two artists, storytelling is a manifestation of the instinct or efforts to constantly speak about the world and reality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; <em>Homin and Jaehwan</em> presents a father and a son, and two artists of distinctly different genres sharing the experience of storytelling in the collocated space of the art exhibition. As the viewers partake in this process, they may be able to view the two artists from an entirely novel perspective and even come to understand the relationship between the artists and their surroundings. Perhaps this exhibition will serve to expand the storytelling of the Joo family into further narratives between the artists and the audience, and among the audience itself.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2021%2F&FILE_NM=20210802181721_437bbf7999524991b5109b7f13c6815b_2130b41f77e841fcbf397220d2499a58,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=603940,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
953326,468,as the Practice of Learning,,Nam-Seoul Museum of Art,2021-05-04,2021-05-16,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Even love requires learning and practice.<br><br>Often love is perceived as a special and romantic feeling that is revealed in a particular relationship, but in truth, it is a common attitude towards understanding and engaging with the world which also becomes an internal motive for living. If the former is a feeling that is shaped by the subject, the latter would be a kind of active pursuit chosen with one’s own will. As was also stated by a German social psychologist, love is not something that we “fall in to,” but is being “engaged with,” and that “in order to truly love, one needs to be learned.” So although we believe that anyone can love, in fact, we don’t really know how to have an understanding of another world and to be in a relationship. Love needs to be practiced.<br><br>The Waiting Room Project #2 as the Practice of Learning focuses on proactive and intentional practice of love as a will and thrust to stand against violence in our daily lives that is derived from the multi-layered discrimination, hatred, and marginalization that exist in Korean society. Love, whether it is eros towards a specific subject or affection for humankind in a broad sense, leads us to experience inversion in discovering the differences between one another through encounters and further to explore the world by superimposing the experiences of others onto oneself. This process enables knowing through understanding such differences and invites us to face an entirely new world. as the Practice of Learning suggests love as a willful practice of learning that leads to change in our attitude and thought, as well as a cause that initiates understanding of differences by confronting things that are considered to be strange, different, and abnormal in daily life.<br><br>Here, love is not something that inhabits one’s domain or which can be practiced in some exceptional circumstances, but a deliberate practice of learning materialized in everyday life confronted by the community and society. This program provides a time to exercise love with the belief that a small practice of love initiated in daily life will be the thrust to rethink and further dismantle the stereotypes concretized in our words and bodies. With a variety of activities merged in learning and practice focusing on words and gestures including lectures, exercises, humming performances, and workshops, held at Nam-Seoul Museum of Art for two weeks from May 4 to 16, will guide us to depart from the silenced mouth and isolated body and to finally enter a state of love.<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220219100356_6c4ba10265f04c6c84a1304215b77dbd_d137b9a31af747adba8649fadc5d22e2,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=953326,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

This exhibition excavates the micro histories related to forced conscription during the Japanese Empire‘s colonial reign, and centers on various archival materials at sites of forced labor. The exhibition visualizes multiple issues concerned with forced conscription and forced labor, and at the same time attempts to tell the stories of anonymous workers who lived through much uncertainty.<br><br>This exhibition sheds light on the daily life of forced laborers and the traces at their residences, the site of forced labor that is now disappearing because of urban development, and the letters of workers and the inscribed memories on their tombstones. Furthermore, the exhibition provides an opportunity to reflect on the meaning of present day labor by exploring the documents of workers’ lives that have been easily forgotten in the vortex of modern and contemporary history.<br><br>The exhibition begins with the figures of workers and the coal mines where most of them were conscripted. Furthermore, actual objects and materials such as ‘Yoon Byeongryol Collection’ vividly show us the daily life of the workers. Additionally, the realities of forced work are revealed through the faces of workers who were mobilized into varied forms of labor, letters that never made it to their intended recipients, testimonials made by their family members, and tombstones that recorded those who died far away from home. The exhibition reinscribes the names that have disappeared from history, resonates with their will and experience of living, empathy and solidarity, and weaves networks of various meanings inherent in the act of labor. Presented at SeMA Bunker, built during the military regime in South Korea, the exhibition encounters the abyss of a mine that used to be a space of the forced laborer’s work and daily life, questions the act of redefining the past and living the present through labor, and crosses the in-between the space of multivalent meanings.<br><br>By linking about 200 archival materials and about 20 contemporary artworks, the exhibition unfolds a variety of stories like a panorama. Narratives take place such as of workers/fathers’ narratives, which hitherto have been largely invisible, gendered memories of mothers and wives that are embodied through archive materials, the present meaning of labor, labor and diaspora, and death and memory, and more are represented here in this exhibition. Through this we hope that the exhibition becomes a place of resonance that calls out the names of numerous individuals who have existed, but up to this point have remained invisible, to ‘exist’ here again.<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220219100614_71e303d7c4d9466ab87ef629d106f479_9f17916262124aacbf6d8d731d56fa97,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=953341,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Moreover, it is necessary, now more than ever, to reexamine the collection based on the online system, considering the increasingly contact-free environment today.<br>In order to achieve these objectives, this exhibition does not center around any specific theme or key artwork, but instead consists of three different projects that unfold at once. First, Excavating -Research and Criticism Project attempts to “excavate” the future direction and new identity of the collection. Second, Hacking-Project for Learning explores various methods of engaging with the artworks in the current age of the COVID-19 pandemic, inviting the artists and viewers to proactively “hack” the collection and reexamine the conditions of value and appreciation. Lastly, Opening-Collection Management System Project “opens” up the museum’s collection management system, which was previously only accessible by the museum staff, in the offline exhibition space to reimagine its standards and systems, ultimately demonstrating the essence of art and its possibilities for expansion through the gaps revealed in the system.<br><br>Seoul Museum of Art strives to renew its endlessly growing collection, and build the foundation for subsequent research.

The mid-career artist’s 40 or so portraits of overseas Korean adoptees provide a sober look at their life trajectories as well her own. The series is presented as part of <em>The Waiting Room Project*</em>, which strives to embody the diverse and heterogeneous voices of viewers. The works resonate with the history of SeMA, Nam-Seoul Museum of Art (formerly the Belgian consulate), which was moved from its original location. The series also shows viewers that South Korea is the only member of the OECD that still allows overseas adoptions.</p><p><br></p><p>The title of the exhibition, <em>Candid Essence*</em>, expresses the disposition of someone who tries to look upon the value of human survival from the place of pure love for her fellow human beings. This phrase also reflects the artist’s own view of the adoptees as well as their Ubermensch-like will to overcome their prescribed conditions with optimism. Painted using a traditional Korean portrait technique since 2018, this series was inspired by the documentary project <em>Side by Side</em> (2018, directed by Glenn and Julie Morey)?which contains interviews with 100 overseas Korean adoptees?that the artist came across by chance. She projects her own layered identity as an immigrant mother onto the faces of adoptees whose stories she listened to with empathy. She studied and revealed the personal histories inscribed onto 50 faces. The subtitle of the exhibition, <em>51 Lives</em>, was named after the artist’s own life and the resilient lives of 50 interviewees in which Eastern and Western cultures clash and coexist.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>The exhibition’s layout&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>encourages an endless exchange between the works and viewers, and constitutes a total of 50 or so paintings, installation, and video works. They include her <em>Ressentiment-Hyo</em> (2012), which is based on the artist’s family history, <em>Music Box</em> series (2013), and finally the <em>Ubermensch</em> series (2018/20) at the center. Park deepens the exploration of her own identity through various relationships such as those between couples and between herself and her parents, siblings, and friends. She questions the traditional concept of a family in Korean culture and shows us that we in fact do not differ much from the figures in the artist’s portraits. <em>Candid Essence: 51 Lives</em> will hopefully act as an impetus for viewers to free themselves from the social structure and mode of thinking that designate the traditional familial structure as a normal family.</span></p><p><br></p><p>* Nam-Seoul Museum of Art is a branch of SeMA, which strives to become a Seoul’s network museum by specializing its branches in the city while developing the different branches simultaneously.

He has consistently pursued an art world of his own intergrating nature, life, and art as a persistent performer and meticulous archivist to overcome the limits of performance art.&nbsp;</p><p>The city of Seoul plans to inaugurate Art Archives, Seoul Museum of Art, which will become the center of the collection, preservation and research of art document resources and has received a total of about 5,000 pieces of resources from the artist since 2018. Thus, the Seoul Museum of Art seeks to suggest a novel perspective to broaden the understanding about the artist by collaborating with Culture Headquarters, Seoul Metropolitan Government and unraveling the artist’s art resources from the 1970s to 2000s in an exhibition. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Himalayas revealed as fine dust is cleared, the canals in Venice that turned brighter emerald; the recent lockdowns implemented due to Covid-19 have revealed beautiful nature around the world. Likewise, is any hidden beauty overlooked in our surroundings? Not only physical things obscure perspectives. “From trembling of grass to,,,wind brushing through trees,”<a href='#_ftn1' name='_ftnref1' title=''>[1]</a> things have been neglected because of human flaws such as taking for granted, familiarity, indifference, and arrogance. The artist seeks to create a gap in the veil of human mind encountering nature and to create an airway to breathe with nature. However, as in the words of the artist, an act of applying breaks of 1, 2, or 3 to ‘the nature of zero’ would be excessive. This is because artificial elements can play the role of another barrier. As a performer, Rim creates a gap by a gesture of non-action converging to zero, in order for the breath of natural being to be sensed.<a href='#_ftn2' name='_ftnref2' title=''>[2]</a></p><p>Understanding a newly categorized and registered archive in the collecting process is like putting difficult puzzle pieces together. The French historian Arlette Farge calls the archive counting unit <em>fonds</em>, which means ‘ocean floor,’ and describes the act of fathoming an extensive archive as being unpredictable like a natural disaster and compares it to diving, submerging and even drowning,<a href='#_ftn3' name='_ftnref3' title=''>[3]</a> illustrating the challenge. Fortunately, conversations with the artist and the artist’s self-written texts were our trustworthy guide, as he has consistently archived records of his own performances and used them as the media for new creations. Furthermore, these conversations provided the joy of discovering additional archives and offered an opportunity to recognize the artist’s recent works not as a shift in artistic stance but as an extension of his performances breaking the boundaries of nature and art by using various methods on top of his unchanging tenor of praising all life out of intense love for nature.</p><p>The title <em>Rise Up</em> <em>Rim Dong Sik</em> is inspired by two performances ? <em>Stand up, and Rise Up</em> ? presented at the first meeting of the outdoor field art <em>Yatoo</em>, held at the Geumgang, Gongju, 1981. It dynamically captures the monumental moment since which Rim has walked a path of his own. The exhibition is largely divided into four themes: <em>Gesture, Flow, Village</em>, and <em>Poetic Notion</em>. From resistance to reality and convention to performances of communion with nature and paintings that navigate between the realms of fact and imagination, the exhibition is structured to allow viewers to follow the chronological flow and characteristics of works of the artist, who did not conform to the dominant tendency of the time and freely express his artistic vision. The artist’s archive in this exhibition is presented as pure creations to be systematically collected, categorized, stored and studied, as well as a cradle of significant artistic inspirations, and not as records that accumulate like sediments in the deep sea. In addition, the recursive summoning of the moment of artistic act that could have been forever forgotten becomes a new creative act transcending time beyond mere purpose of documentation and a product with unlimited expandability. With this type of development as the horizontal which tracks Rim’s artistic trajectory as a lifelong archivist and performer, the four distinct themes of the exhibition become the verticals that intersect this, together encompassing the artistic activities of Rim as a nature artist that are both overarching and individualized by period.&nbsp;</p><p>This exhibition will both be the initial step toward archive-related research and an opportunity to comprehensively witness the artistic methods of Rim, an artist who has transformed the numerous processes of approaching nature ceaselessly and passionately into an art. In addition, it is hoped such attempts would lead to further research about the artist who wants to be called as a ‘pondering one’ and offer opportunities for many to take interest in future projects at the&nbsp;Art Archives, Seoul Museum of Art.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p><a href='#_ftnref1' name='_ftn1' title=''>[1]</a> An excerpt from Yatoo Declaration by Rim Dong Sik, 1981.

The actions of the artist that instigates the event, along with the participation of the viewers who witness and interact, consist the core element of a performance. However, all of these elements vanish as the performance concludes, only leaving their traces in time through memory and experience. Such temporary and immaterial nature of performance art simultaneously embraces the value that is grounded in the fleeting essence of time, as much as it confronts the limitations of time.</p><p dir='ltr'>&nbsp;Against this background, <em>This Event </em>intends to examine various artistic attempts and communication methods in the realm of visual art in understanding performance art through the multiple layers inherent to the genre. In 2020, as we face the unprecedented pandemic crisis of COVID-19, the society at large continues to shift towards a “no contact” paradigm, and it is in this context that this exhibition aims to focus on the genre of performance art, which has been highlighted by the experience on site. Therefore,<em> This Event </em>encompasses the process of examining the essence of performance art, methods of presenting such immaterial art in the form of an exhibition, and conditions of appreciating the genre in the age of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p dir='ltr'>&nbsp;To examine the ways of communicating and recategorizing performance art from multiple perspectives, this exhibition is curated in collaboration with co-curators &nbsp;Junghyun Kim, Haeju Kim, Hyun-Suk Seo, and organized into four different themes ? Archive, Site, Time, and Physical Presence.</p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'>&nbsp;<em>Traces of an Event</em> examines the traces and archives of performance art through scores, drawings, and instructions that reflect on the aspects of physical participation and fleeting time, and further contemplates on their individual role and meaning.

This body of time is water that has a shape but cannot be touched, symbolizing a “flow.” The imaginary story of this passage of time swimming like a regular clock and then unpredictably reversing its direction can be thought of concerning the daily accidents we experience in our lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, those unpredictable events that compose our day fill our lifetime with complex emotions that cannot be explained through a usual conception of time, with the relationships that form upon sharing those emotions and with the regret, trauma, retrospection, and enlightenment caused by such relationships. Therefore, they go beyond the realm of our time to influence our emotions and encourage a creative imagination about what is ultimately spiritual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Based on this worldview of imagination, The Journey of Eternity seeks to introduce “exhibition as an experience,” where the audience can immerse themselves in emotions beyond what can be seen or heard and reflect upon their memories in hope.</p><p><br></p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Full-live Performance: 6. 2, 13, 20, 7-8PM</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Public Program 6.10, 12, 17, 6-7 PM&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Improvisation Performance &nbsp;6.6, 9, 12-4 PM &nbsp;Live Performance due to the exhibition hours</p><p><br></p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Online Booking <a href='https://forms.gle/xzUH3Z8BFqF23Vt18' target='_blank'><u>https://forms.gle/xzUH3Z8BFqF23Vt18</u></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STAGE 1 Frame City | The Structure of Time</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kyung Hwa Shon,</strong> in her film and variable-dimension installation work &lt;Every Second in Between&gt;, explores how formative structures can themselves become a narrative. Famous for being home to the BBC Studios, the White City area used to be where national exhibition events of the British Empire took place, as well as where immigrants settled; today, the city is in the middle of a rapid change due to urban redevelopment. Through interviews with the locals, the artist has formatively interpreted the landscape of the city, resulting in a symbolic scene of life. As the title suggests, in “every second in between,” time becomes a place and forms particular relationships, resulting in a series of phenomena that functions as a psychological map of an imaginary character named ‘Stillman.’</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dong Geun Lee,</strong> through folding and shaping of a flat surface, explores the behavioral process revealed through the two- and three-dimensionality of an object. The visuo-cognitive desires and the unique experimentation of the planar surface due to the mingling of expectations can be seen as a structural approach to painting.</p><p>His representative work, the &lt;Frankie’s Lover&gt; collaboration, reconstructs a previous work to add to its meaning the notion of time presented through a reshaping of a plane. Also, the work condenses emotions like anticipation or fear towards movement and discovery of space and location, conveyed through the experiment of a stepwise evolution of the flat surface.</p><p>Titled after a pet name of Frankenstein, the work serves as a metaphor for a being of possibility, in its assembly, rejoining, and rebirth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STAGE 2 Fluid Clock | The Flow of Time</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eve Kwak</strong> presents an installation work &lt;Flowerland, Starland, Heaven, Hell&gt;, notable especially for its spatial experimentation that evokes an abrupt and particular spatiotemporal experience. The title comes from a popular childhood play, in which one uses the number of strokes for writing one’s name to fortune-tell the world one will be in the afterlife, directly and indirectly, revealed through a coalition of everyday objects. The verses from Han Seok-bong’s calligraphy (a clich? in commercial folding screens) conveys a touching sentiment of one’s remaining years, communicating the notion of time through a mingling of old objects in their usage and commercial roles. Also featured are &lt;Rough Sketch 2&gt;, &lt;Cloth Hanger Man 2&gt;, and &lt;Just. Now. %&gt;, presented as abstract form structures that create a dynamic along with the meaning derived from the textures of composite objects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nicolas Pelzer’s&nbsp;</strong>double-channel video installation work &lt;Soul Always Return to Itself&gt; is presented in such a way as if two screens were facing each other through a mirror. In the work, a 3D image industrial structure revolves in a shape similar to a human heart, reminiscent of archaeological remains from the prehistoric era. Alongside are two projectors that cast shadows of each other and reveal each other’s existence on the screen, functioning as a critique of the materialistic fantasy and innovative technology consumed in the modern digital era.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STAGE 3 I Flat Staircase | The Union and Relationship of Time</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hansaem Kim</strong> presents his new series work &lt;Whirlpool I &amp; II&gt; and &lt;Wave I ~ IV&gt; where he introduces an adventurous epic of the eternality of time. A structure that reveals an imaginary worldview of games is transformed through a peculiar relief work into a planar surface where water in a flow of water, symbolizes pain that one unwantedly encounters in life. The process in which the symbolic paintings of distinct waves move in and out of the trajectory of now and eternity is introduced through pixel images and six planar paintings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Junhyun Bae</strong> projects a critical view on utopia in his series of painting works &lt;Discoverer&gt;, &lt;Explorer&gt;, and &lt;Finder&gt;, which are replicated and extended into large wall paintings installed along with the exhibition space. Imitating reportage, the imaginary landscapes filling the exhibition space have been taken from events of social injustice and disasters, reconstructed into a fictional vision that reminds us of an unspecified scene beyond our time.</p><p>At the same time, the works call into question the confusion caused by the vision of utopia as presented in the media. The original pieces of work, as well as their unrestrained modification and extension in form, bring to attention the errors that can be produced in imaginary stimulations and fictitious fantasies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STAGE 4 I Flora Rail | The Retrospect of Time</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Mingyu Song</strong> presents in a single landscape a scene that forms through a coalition of nighttime and daytime with space, region, and environment. The result is at once a landscape of forms, where the phase, the technique, and the logic of painting are stimulated, and a landscape of society, where such elements meet the structure of downtown or the language of the humanities. The presented piece &lt;How Six People Look at the Moon&gt; abstractly treats the motion and time of that which exists but nonmaterially flows, like a circular flight trajectory or a satellite in the night sky. The works &lt;Unfolded Moon&gt; and &lt;Black bay 9-10&gt; interpret deeper concepts of darkness and light through pure forms following the social values of colored sides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sueyeon Hwang</strong> presents a work consisting of theatrical paper sculptures titled &lt;Dung Fly&gt;, &lt;Stupidity&gt;, and &lt;Night&gt;. Each being a separate solid and yet united in space as a single collection, the sculptures reveal, through their completed state, the process of sculpting―i.e., the history of a solid. The unique time of this process gradually morphs into a formative time of clothing a material. The properties like quantity, force, weight, friction, height all transform into moments of change, and eventually the abstract structures intended by the artist―namely, the simple forms of the word combined into moments of humor―leave the sculpture existing as a body put on the original material.</p><p><br></p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Exhibition Production: The Great Commission</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Curator: Zoe Chun</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Artists: Dong Geun Lee, Eve Kwak, Hansaem Kim, Junhyun Bae, Kyung Hwa Shon, Mingyu Song, Nicolas Pelzer, Sueyeon Hwang</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Performers: Da Hey Kang, Gwanmok Lee, Han Kim, Yu Ra Jo</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Acting Director: Jihee Kim&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Music Producers: SEP, Woochi&nbsp;</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Lighting Designer: Ari Kim</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Stage Designer: Sooran Kim (<u>OURS</u>TUDIO)</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Designer: Hyeyeon Lee (Standard Document)</p><p style='margin-left: 20px;'>Photographer: Seungman Park</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Great Commission</strong> (directed by Zoe Chun) is a non-profit contemporary art organization that facilitates the production of exhibitions, performances, and publications.

The exhibition features works by women artists in the GanaArt Collection, which is a collection of 200 works donated to the Seoul Museum of Art in 2001 by Gana Art Chairman Lee Ho-jae. The collection includes Minjung Art and Realism works that dynamically reflect the social realities of Korea in the 1980s&nbsp;?&nbsp;90s. In the exhibition, Kim Wonsook, Park In-kyung, Song Mae-Hee, Song Hyun-sook, Ahn Sung-keum and Hahn Ai-kyu express their reflections of their reality and their own conflicts with a society that they face in everyday life. These works shed light on the roles of women defined in the family at the time, perceive the perplexing image of the times, and allude to the oppression enforced upon women.</p><p><br></p><p>Minjung Art pursued art that wasn’t isolated from life in the dark political situation, and was developed through small group art movements mainly led by male artists. Nho Wonhee joined as a female member of ‘Reality and Utterance’, the key small group art movement of 1980s, depicting a condensed portrait of the society of the time. 1980s was period when the feminist art movement had officially kicked off in Korea, as women artists practicing Minjung Art began to question the reality of women through their exhibitions. <em>Herstory Review&nbsp;</em>presents works by artists who explored and made manifest feminist issues in the context of Minjung Art, which was a movement directed at social reform. <em>Baneseo hanaro (From Half to One)</em> (1986), the exhibition considered to be the inception of feminist art in Korea, to the<em>&nbsp;Yeoseonggwa hyeonsil (Women and Reality)</em> exhibitions held annually from 1987 to 1994, and a poetry painting exhibition by women <em>Uri botmur?l t?ja: y?sung heabang-si-wa k?rim?i eu man’nam</em> held in 1988 were important feminist art exhibitions that played a central role in the cultural dimension and feminist movement. Artists who showed their works in these exhibitions―Kim In Soon, Kim Djinsuk, Yun Suknam, Jung Jungyeob and Park Youngsook, etc.―demonstrated a different aspect from other women artists in the GanaArt Collection.</p><p><br></p><p>Exploration into self and identity are more evidently discovered in other Korean women artists from abroad at the same time, such as Yong Soon Min and Jin-me Yoon. As non-Western immigrant women living in the Western hemisphere and as an “other” who doesn’t belong anywhere, they explore the diaspora sentimentality in race, gender, nation, history and memory, bringing identity as the main focus of their work. As feminist issues continue to surface today, this exhibition aspires to look back on the pivotal moments in feminist art in Korean modern art history, centering on the Seoul Museum of Art collection which has been acquiring works steadily since 2000. Ultimately, the exhibition wishes to rediscover these women artists by shedding light on the intersection of their perspectives on the time period and society in the 1980s.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220310110159_9c58fe5fdb4445bb97fc9b1e3f17412c_4f663e4313c847f1aecf89abb6ac9f19,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=524634,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

At the same time, the images reflect on the social history, structure and paradox revealed through the lives of individuals. This exhibition includes images not from those special moments that we memorialize, but from the everyday moments in life. As smartphones replace cameras, and as the prices of cameras fall while its technology advances, photographs are no longer just a popular commodity, but now a universal one. Accordingly, the unique, emotional value of photographs has also declined. The emergence of digital photography, and the dematerialization of the medium as a result, make it increasingly more difficult to define its significance today. This exhibition, therefore, hopes to examine those moments where photography matters again. The moments when photography makes a difference is no different from what they are. At times, however, we realize the value of those moments through photographs, only after they have passed by. This exhibition hopes to demonstrate how photography can still make a difference in ways which we have failed to realize those moments.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style='font-size: 12px;'><br></span></p><p><span style='font-size: 12px;'>JEON SEEYOUNG, <em>quarter 151-174</em>, 2015-2017, Digital inkjet print, Dimension variable, Courtesy of the artist</span></p><p><span style='font-size: 12px;'>MASAFUMI SANAI, <em>Living</em>, 1995 (printed in 2020), C-print, 105.5×129cm ?

A collection of various books selected from works that convey nature, is available on the view in ‘Green Library’, while new-media collections in set schedule can be experienced in the comfortable space of the ‘Media Theater’.

It might not be easy for the busy audience today to view the entire exhibition, but we invite you to take some time out to explore the different aspects of life. This exhibition is completed by the audience when they feel understood and connected to each other through the works, and when they start to feel that they want their lives to head to a better direction.

The members of these collectives might have changed or stayed the same, but as in general, they work by sharing opinions and discussions, gathering and organizing thoughts together. Reflecting life in togetherness, their works talk about technology, development, migration, labor, isolation and disasters that endlessly arise in the massive flow of capitalism and globalization.&nbsp;These works shed a serious outlook on the social problems that can happen to any one of us who happens to be born into this world of adventure and experimentation, yet overlook them as if they’re some news from a remote place.</span></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><strong>Reference Room</strong></span><br></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>‘Reference Room’ presents works by female artists, which make up 24% of the collection at SeMA. These female artists (Suki Seokyeong Kang, Koh San Keum, Kim Jipyeong, Shin Mee-kyoung, Haegue Yang, Yeesookyung, Jiin You(JU JU U), Siren eun young Jung, Seungean Cha and Choi Hae ri) traverse across the east and west, past and present, making references to music, literature, art, drama and history in their works. These references from different places and times are summoned by female artists and interpreted in a different context, as a way of deepening the understanding of the world in their works. These artists continuously ask rhetorical questions to themselves as to the social background of the references, and their significance to us in this era. Their works involve the process of engaging in a conversation with these references, looking at them, listening to their stories, retracing their meaning, and expressing the artists’ own thoughts. As a result, their works create a world where everyone is connected. In this space, works that creatively intervene in things that already exist or cast a twisted view on the world, tell the viewer about their own stories, engaging with them in conversations that are at times soft while at other times chatty.</span></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><strong>Green Library</strong></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>In the ‘Green Library’, Eco Bridge?A Rotary with 9 Piers from the collection is expanded to include various growing plants. Here, artists who work with nature and everyday life (Oksun Kim, Kim Ju Hyun, Hyuk Jun Yi, and Eun Chun) add their own sense of warm sunlight, lush vegetation, and fascinating narratives. Nature is an essential existence to human life. It’s a vast site where not only visible beings like humans, animals and plants exist, but also invisible beings form relationships and coexist. A collection of books on the subject of nature, safety measures, race and the female body, etc, is provided in collaboration with the Neutinamu Library in Yongin-si in order to offer education on ways of living with nature.

Screened in 3 different theaters in differently set times, the works cast an insightful and witty reflections on various social problems that we face, including labor, virus, division, capitalism, war, dwelling, and violence, etc. While comfortable couches are provided for a relaxing viewing experience, the content of the works are quite unsettling. In addition, the works may be short in terms of duration, they’re never light in terms of the subject matter and meaning.

A documentation of the performance on ‘walking’, the work not only explores the gesture of ‘walking’ as an ordinary process to reach a certain purpose, but also expresses the gesture and language of the act of walking itself. As we walk, following a performer on the screen in the large space, we reflect on things that are so ordinary that they go unnoticed and are blindly passed by.</span></p><p dir='ltr'><br></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'><strong>Crystal Gallery</strong></span></span></p><p dir='ltr'><span style='font-family: apercu-light-pro;'>Finally, Yun Ai Young’s installation work made of diverse colors, shapes and forms, switches and light bulbs is shown in ‘Crystal Gallery’.

Celebrating the fourteenth installment of the series, this year’s first exhibition invites graphic designer Na Kim. Extending beyond the realm of design, Na Kim’s multifaceted practice, based in Korea and abroad, highlights the formal elements of graphic design through fine art.</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition’s title, <em>Bottomless Bag</em>, is taken from the bag appearing in the animated film <em>Inside Out</em> (2015). Filled with the main character’s memories and their associated orbs, along with an assortment of other objects, the film’s imaginary bag was chosen to illustrate the exhibition’s core concepts of ‘memory’ and ‘collection.’</p><p><br></p><p>The Korean title of the exhibition references the school supply?filled ‘object bags’ sold to students in Korea during the 1980s and 1990s. Remembering this nostalgic object of the past, the exhibition hopes to examine the times and memories connected by the objects.</p><p><br></p><p>In this exhibition, the space itself becomes the designer’s ‘object bag,’ where the images exhibited in the space become the ‘objects’ that evoke past memories and serve as the designer’s tools for a new experiment. The exhibition invites visitors to experience the meaning of those found objects collected and archived by Na Kim inside the museum space.</p><p><br></p><p>‘Collecting’ is an important part of SeMA’s agenda for 2020, as well as Na Kim’s design methodology. By setting her own rules in interpreting and creating relationships with the memories embedded in everyday objects, Kim demonstrates a respectful attitude that observes and appreciates the value of everyday life.</p><p><br></p><p>With this exhibition, the museum aims to generate new forms of knowledge by adopting Na Kim’s work process as an educational model, and by mediating and reconfiguring it. In understanding design as a language of communication, it is hoped that through Na Kim’s design-oriented thinking and visual language, viewers will be able to strengthen their visual literacy, which will allow them to better interpret, criticize, and create images.</p><p><br></p><p>Seoul Museum of Art is temporarily closed in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the safety of visitors. <em>Bottomless Bag</em> will be available for viewing when the museum reopens.</p><p><br></p><p>More details on the exhibition can be found online at the Seoul Museum of Art website at sema.seoul.go.kr.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2020%2F&FILE_NM=20200422155644_f0bbc55763e44cff82bfc916798ed52d_ae4ebe521c244d0d8cac3d296f2ae7eb,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=497062,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Together, Lee and Han transformed the lobby space of the Seoul Museum of Art, Seosomun Main Building.

While working with the various elements of function and design of the past, Han activated the mediating space in a way that separates it from its surrounding while not severing it from its environment. For Mire Lee, Han replaced the opaque vision-blocking marble wall with see-through wire fence, and arranged colonnades that emphasize verticality.</p><p>Meanwhile, the tables and chairs provided for resting and educational programs in Nam-Seoul Museum of Art have been designed to be disassembled or assembled and connected together, and can also be put together in different ways according to the program.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2020%2F&FILE_NM=20200214152500_88b8ff10e99f4d718566ecfc0fdee264_fa8543e1c7f34ede8120b1294966df89,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=475621,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Leandro Erlich is an internationally-exhibited contemporary artist whose work has been widely acclaimed for both its originality and popularity. His installations transform familiar, everyday spaces, such as an elevator, staircase and swimming pool by creating optical illusions using mirrors and other various materials. &nbsp;</p><p>The artist’s current exhibition at the Buk-SeMA, <em>Leandro Erlich: Both Sides Now,&nbsp;</em>goes beyond examining his central theme of “perception,” and further questions the relationship between the “Subject” and the “Other.” Whereas the artist’s previous exhibitions explored concepts such as “the illusion and the real,” or “the imaginary and the truth” by reminding the viewers of how the world we perceive and the real are not always the same, this exhibition focuses on how the “I,” or the “Subject,” is formed through surrounding relationships, and therefore makes the boundaries between the “Subject” and the “Other” ambiguous. Those boundaries, which separate two seemingly different entities, remain variable according to their conditions and circumstances. There is nothing in this world whose essence or nature is invariable. Everything that consists of our world is connected, and their boundaries are far from clear-cut. As shadows change according to their light source, the world we perceive, and those we regard as the “Other,” exist as shadows created by our own perspectives.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Presented across four exhibition galleries of the museum, this exhibition introduces new works <em>Car Cinema</em> and <em>In the Shadow of the Pagoda</em>, two site-specific installations that dominate the space with their massive scale and ends with <em>The Cloud(South Korea, North Korea)</em>, a sculptural piece reflecting on the theme of the exhibition. Offering a unique viewer experience, the exhibition will also present a selection of Erlich’s earlier works.

Various aspects of life are imbued with repetition; visible or not, iteration has a stronghold over how a good portion of the world, as well as physical and mental activities within it is structured. In general, repetition indicates 'doing the same thing over and over again.' Yet the term is subject to negative connotations, leaning more towards duplication or imitation than to the origin, creation, and newness. However, the essential aspect of repetition since postmodernism is not subsumed under the mechanism of identity, or the return to sameness. Instead, it has emerged as the source of creation, socially and politically reinterpreted based on the contemporary perspective that 'difference is the result of iteration.' Based on this notion, this exhibition explores the 'compulsion,' a psycho-pathological manifestation, not as a personal concern but in terms of the social and structural matter.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>Compulsion indicates a 'form of repetitive behavior that is compelled by the internal urge.' This exhibition highlights the repetitive trait of compulsion while pointing to the very repetitiveness as a potential of overcoming it. In an era where the capitalist system has consumed the prospect of life, <em>Compulsion to Repeat&nbsp;</em>attempts to become the testing ground of critical thinking where nine participating artists interpret and question the world around them based on the compulsive circumstances of today</span>’<span lang='EN-US'>s people represented by the pursuit of a meaningful life. From this ground of ample potential, the artists set out to find an opportunity of implosion instead of looking for an innovative solution from the outside. A way out of compulsion lies not on the outside&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>?&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>violation of the norm or inauguration of alternatives&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>?&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>but on the inside. The drive to repeat oneself within the habitual compulsion, or the 'compulsion of compulsion' or&nbsp;</span>“<span lang='EN-US'>compulsion x compulsion</span>”<span lang='EN-US'>&nbsp;is the strategy of artistic appropriation that runs through the exhibition. In this sense, 'Compulsion<sup>2</sup>' is a singular mark that indicates how repetition is the inherent nature of compulsion. Repetition is the only move that could open up a gap within the compulsion of the era, and a critical element of art as a compulsive act. Nine participating artists who repeat a piece of reality in variations with various mediums including painting, video, photography, and sculpture reflecting the multiplicity of the world we live in. The exhibition demonstrates individual works in temporal and spatial, thematic and structural repetition to experiment and explore how repetition leads to creation.&nbsp;</span></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20191204174046_ef8e0cd1d339472da05a1044878463d9_9e424599f42e4d2ab470a6286cf5cd46,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=442703,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The inaugural exhibition in 2015 focused on Africa, followed in 2017 by a focus on Latin America; in 2019, <em>gohyang: home&nbsp;</em>presents contemporary art from the Middle East. Considering initial impressions, such as memories of several Korean corporations that developed nuclear power plant and other large-scale construction projects in the Middle East since the 1970s, the complicated sociopolitical conditions of the region viewed through the perspective of news media, and social prejudices and fears toward recent refugees arriving in Korea from the Middle East, we may have mistakenly assumed that stereotypes formed through biased information were tantamount to actual knowledge about the Middle East region. The proposed practical tasks of this exhibition are reflecting on Arabic culture and the art it inspires both of which are still seemingly unfamiliar in Seoul, and restoring a sense of place to a region that had already been lost before even existing, by observing the specificity of the Arab world, which has been lost before even existing, by observing the specificity of the Arab world, which has been abstractly expanded and perceived without any authentic knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition consists of four parts presented across two floors of Seoul Museum of Art. To begin, 'Memorial Structure', deals with the specific conflict between Palestine and Israel, through photographic documentary, the archival image of memory, multi-media installation based on private experience and questions of our perceptions and beliefs toward conditions in the Arab world. The exhibition’s second part, 'What Makes Us', examines how we register collective bonds from the dimension of ritual practice, understood as a measure of sentiment for a certain idealism that fulfills feelings of loss or lack evoked within the axis of grand time called history. As such, this ritualistic sense of connection could be seen as 'an imagined value,' constructed afterwards out of yearning for something that never existed. 'Storytelling as Silence,' the exhibition’s third part, presents a series of narratives by different artists that assert a contemporaneity that manifests itself as a new origin of existence. The exhibition concludes with '(un)home' dealing with the experience of something that is strangely familiar, and offering the potential to go further into a hope for recovery or treatment from loss and dismay.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Art seeks for new methods of weaving together promised or unpromised time in a meaningful way. Accordingly, <em>gohyang:home&nbsp;</em>introduces the diversity of artistic practices from the Middle East and Arab world, encourages participation in sympathy that could be imagined from a Korean perspective and pursues clues that enable us to relate to each other. The title <em>gohyang:home&nbsp;</em>indicates the geographical sense of a hometown in Korean, while expanding to a virtual world where one can overcome the feeling of loss and exclusion; it also represents an impulse to settle down, vague sensibilities of nostalgia and longing, and inevitably, an imperfect logic.</p><p><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20191204164508_d02b4c289e10481d9891ef0796cdadda_6dc2cf9bc6a1434c8438726145f5fbd6,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=438864,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Starting this year, <em>Title Match</em> departs from its previous format of juxtaposing an established artist with an emerging artist, but now opens up to include two artists (or collectives) of all ages. This year’s exhibition presents artists Hyungkoo Lee and Min Oh, whose works examine the subject of human body, sense and perception through unique perspectives.</span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;font-size:13px;font-family:&quot;맑은 고딕&quot;;'><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'>The human body has been a central subject and motif in art for centuries. With the collapse of the rationalist worldview that was long at the heart of Western thought, the human body has reemerged as an important subject matter for artists today more than ever before, providing them an endless source of inspiration and creativity. Such a change derives from the realization that no matter how desperately we, as humans, try to reach the absolute and transcend our own existence here and now, we are ultimately physical and organic beings.</span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;font-size:13px;font-family:&quot;맑은 고딕&quot;;'><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'>In the manner of a pseudo-scientist, artist Hyungkoo Lee analyzes, deconstructs and reconstructs the human body. Lee experiments with enlarging human body parts using his devices and contraptions, and expanding our sense and perception through media. Through his works, the artist reveals the incredible ability of the human body to adopt and systematically function in its given environment. In this exhibition, Lee introduces his new work, <em>Kiamkoysek</em>, which further expands on the artist’s concepts of the human body. Enveloping the viewer with its vast, landscape-like scenery, the large-scale work reveals the anagogic relationship between man and universe by transforming images of human bones into a landscape of oddly-shaped rocks (<em>Kiamkoysek</em>) that embody the laws of nature.</span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;font-size:13px;font-family:&quot;맑은 고딕&quot;;'><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'>Artist Min Oh creates works that analyze and deconstruct musical structures through the eyes of a performer, or those that examine the physical sensations and conditions of performers on stage. In this exhibition, Oh examines the sensations and reactions internalized in the performers’ bodies during training to achieve the moment of perfect control, while also focusing on their body language caught between repetition and difference, familiarity and unfamiliarity when they are put under unstable circumstances beyond their control. Oh’s three new works for this exhibition center on an ?tude composition which requires specific techniques to master. The works connect to Oh’s earlier works on the theme of performance as mastering the ?tude, in turn, leads to the beginning of mastering another piece that requires the same techniques. Through her works, Oh probes into the process of endless practice that is repeated until the performers would unconsciously react to every movement and sound in their own heads, then recalls those moments into the present of here and now.&nbsp;</span></p><p style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:justify;font-size:13px;font-family:&quot;맑은 고딕&quot;;'><span style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0);'>Presenting the works of Hyungkoo Lee and Min Oh together in the format of a title match, the exhibition highlights the artists’ unique attitudes and methods of analyzing and deconstructing the objects revealed in the process of production, then reconstructing them according to their own rules. The juxtaposition of the works also emphasizes the artists’ extraordinary perspectives on examining the subject of human body and perception. At the same time, the viewers will be able to appreciate the exceptional formal beauty of their works which goes beyond any comparison between the two artists. Through the works of Hyungkoo Lee and Min Oh, the exhibition hopes to provide an opportunity for the viewers to reexamine the subject of human body in the context of cultural conditions and discursive environment of our society today. </span></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180905104446_884fc75b6a0c43fea1e5d7795d830fcb_7f7aeebdea714aabaed283bf19e8e56f,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=276437,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The title of the exhibition, taken from Anne? Olofsson’s work <u>Will you still love me tomorrow?</u>, captures the sense of anxiety and fears in the Korean society where people are forced to look at aging through a contemporary view that pressures one to be and look young.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Globally, the average human life expectancy and the proportion of the population over 60 have nearly doubled over the past few decades. In the same manner, Korean is also on the verge of becoming a super-aged society, with people over 65 years of age taking over 20% of the population. Despite such rapid changes in the composition of population and life cycle, aging is still associated with being old and weak in the capitalist society, and this is predominantly approached with an economic, rather than social logic. A term that emerged in such social atmosphere is 'ageism', which defines discrimination and stereotypes based on age. Ageism amplifies oppression, alienation and inequality both individually and collectively, and exerts a strong influence over all generations. To make matters worse, mass media reinforces the negative stereotypes about aging.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Will you still love me tomorrow?</u> is presented through three exhibition sections and public program zones, aiming to examines the negative perceptions surrounding aging and to examine the influences as well as the origin of such negative perceptions on an individual and society. The first section observes aging in the context of the capitalistic social atmosphere where aging is consumed only on a superficial level through plastic surgery, shopping and obsessive self-maintenance. The second section observes social problems such as conflict between generations and alienation, through the different perceptions on aging by the individual and society. Lastly, the third section presents works that look into the near future, and invite us to think about aging in the context of one’s own narrative. In the exhibition, there are also audience-participatory works that propose new perceptions regarding aging.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Based on the unique experiences, perspectives and social backgrounds of the fifteen artists and artist teams in this exhibition working in fields of art, design and architecture, attempt to overcome the various types of discrimination in their work, fueled in a society that demands the captivating capital of ‘youth’. Hopefully, the exhibition stimulates new ways of looking at aging, and invites us to explore innovative approaches to a longer life.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Section 1 : Anxious Desire&nbsp;</p><p>This section raises questions on the social atmosphere where beauty and ugliness are defined by whether one is young or not. Under this atmosphere, aging is considered through the perspective of one’s appearance. In particular, this section tries to examine how the human desire to resist the corporeal aging influences the body, mind, and life of individuals with regards to capitalism and consumer society. People in our time, who blindly pursue the uniform sense of beauty out of fear and anxiety against aging, attempt to overcome aging through a variety of obsessive self-management and consumption. In this section, through images that are created from the difference and conflict between the needs and desire of people in our time, aging becomes a subject of reflection that is deeper than what it seems to be on the surface.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Section 2 : Ageist myths and streotypes&nbsp;</p><p>Section 2 examines how stereotypes about aging are reinforced within social relations. Ageism justifies discrimination and alienation based on one’s age. It justifies devaluation and alienation of aged people. This section surveys the rampant ageism in the society as well as social issues that occur by the difference on the idea of aging between individuals and group under the capitalist system that escalates ageism.</p><p><br></p><p>Section 3 : The Future Not Afar</p><p>The first and second sections looked at the influence of the anxiety about aging on individuals and different aspects of how such anxiety manifests within social relations.

Renovated from the building standing on the site of Paik’s “House With the Large Gate,” where he spent his childhood, the space welcomes constant visitors with various exhibitions that present the results of explorations of Paik’s artistic practice and the reconstructions of connections that founded his artistic and philosophical grounds. This exhibition will take place in the monumental space and will propose another dimension of the performative, consisting of <em>The Rock Garden</em>, an archival presentation of the old house where Paik lived from the age of five to twelve and <em>Action Music</em>, a presentation of the results from the workshop, co-produced by local participants. The starting point of the exhibition is the ‘memories’ around Paik and takes as protagonists ‘the ones who remember’ Paik he was before he became an artist. In doing so, it attempts to throw new light onto the facets of certain space and time of Paik’s childhood, on which his artistic world was based as well as finding the points of connection to us here and now. <em>Action Music&nbsp;</em>in the Rock Garden will continue until February 29, 2020, together with the inaugural exhibition<em>&nbsp;Tomorrow, the World Will Be Beautiful.</em></p><p><br></p><p dir='ltr'>Exhibition Period: Saturday July 20, 2019?Saturday February 29, 2020</p><p dir='ltr'>Venue: Nam June Paik Memorial House, 2-1 Jong-ro 53-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea (Changsin-dong)</p><p dir='ltr'>Opening Reception: Saturday July 20, 2019, 3 PM</p><p dir='ltr'>Global Groove&nbsp;(4 workshops): Saturday May 25?Saturday June 29, 2019</p><p dir='ltr'>Television Art (3 workshops): Monday July 1?Monday August 26, 2019</p><p dir='ltr'>Organized by Seoul Museum of Art</p><p dir='ltr'>In Association with Nam June Paik Family, Friends of Nam June Paik and Residents of Changsin-dong</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190821174146_f3f7ebc630524d45bd2e00153ca70a11_49c45c0e01254814be7f8d07843f06d7,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=384004,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The title of the exhibition is inspired by Lee Taejoon’s novel, “Planting a Flowering Tree,” where the flowering tree may symbolize both modernity but also those left behind for the sake of modernity. Therefore, the reality it represents may be harsh and severe, but abundant and splendid at once, reflecting an era that evokes both nostalgia and despair in people’s memory. Ridden with contradictions, this period of modernization in Korean history still remains impossible to define even after a century, yet the changes it has brought fundamentally shapes the Korean society today. Looking back on the dreams and aspirations of artists from this period, this exhibition hopes to examine how their meaningful accomplishments resonate in our culture today.</p><p><br></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>1. The Birth ofthe Modern Man</span></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>Since theintroduction of modern Western culture, the lives of Korean people began tochange rapidly. Modern conveniences and education not only changed thestructural aspects of society, but fundamentally transformed the wayindividuals recognized their self-identity and subjectivity, and reshaped therelationships between the individual and society, as well as the subject andobject. Modern men and women sought to escape the traditional boundaries ofclass and family, aspiring to achieve individual goals through one’s owntalents. The modern profession of being an artist became a symbol ofindependence, while a new generation of women emerged as the new leaders ofmodern education. Relationships within family also changed dramatically, asportrayed in the paintings of modern family openly expressing affection betweenspouses, and toward their children.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p>2. Expanded Visibility</p><p><span lang='EN-US'>The educated modern man broke away from the idealism and abstract mindset of the past, and instead began to closely examine the everyday life and its surrounding. This</span><span lang='EN-US'>&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>shift in intellectual thought sparked a new desire to represent reality as it is, not only in the academically-trained classical style but also in a wide range of formal experimentations</span><span lang='EN-US'>&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>including the fragmentation of objects through scientific vision and composition of the picture plane</span><span lang='EN-US'>&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>according to lighting. Still life and landscape paintings of objects and nature reflect the changes in the ways of viewing the object. Still life no longer relied on conventional symbolism but focused on projecting one’s emotion onto the objects, while&nbsp;</span><span lang='EN-US'>landscape paintings shifted from the idealistic scenery to everyday surrounding.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>3. Towards Universality&nbsp;</span></p><p align='left'><span lang='EN-US'>Driven by colonialism, the modernization of Korea was riddenwith contractions, but nevertheless, artists strived to capture the changes inpeople’s lives amidst the tumultuous times. Abstract art dominated the globalart world during this time, and likewise artists in Korea delved into the trendas they aspired to create art that was universal. The last section of theexhibition examines how the movement of abstract art in Korea came to form anddevelop autonomously. Going beyond simply following the style of their Westerncounterparts, artists attempted to develop a new formal expression that embodiedthe essence and tradition of Korea, and based on this uniqueness, maintaintheir relevance in the global contemporary art world.&nbsp;</span></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190821145905_ae5fe78898e841b0a6b8b75d945f5024_3b7ceeabbe2d4effbcda2d8d8e6b6525,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=394091,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Gimhongsok has been reinterpreting concepts and ideas that are embedded in different phenomena that occur in and around art, disrupting the conventional perception of art. In the meantime, SEO Hyun-Suk has been examining the meaning of theatricality and architecture by connecting different places and locations under the context of modernity.</p><p><br>For 2019 Title Match, Gimhongsok presents works that reveal discomfort incurred by ‘incompleteness’ and ‘imperfection.’ The works deal with the suspicion towards ‘completeness,’ ‘perfection,’ and ‘order’ under the title Human Order. The project reconsiders the order and structure created through social consensus, such as the conventional concepts of beauty and artwork. The artist also puts himself under self-censorship through which he discloses his own suspicion and caution towards what he has been accepting as activities that fall under different categories of art activities.</p><p><br>In Theatre of Dusts, SEO Hyun-Suk invites viewers to look at the alternative reality in which Buk-Seoul Museum of Art turned into ‘ruins.’ Created in the form of virtual reality, the work overviews a situation where the ideal of the avant-garde, which dreamed of utopia and believed that art could change the world, has been collapsed. In addition, the viewers are asked to become performers of the artist’s site-specific performance and roam through the museum’s gallery and different spaces inside and outside the museum building, sensing emotional stir through a variety of artistic devices staged by the artist.</p><p><br>In 2019 Title Match, Gimhongsok’s ‘incompleteness’ and SEO Hyun-Suk’s ‘ruins’ are working as concepts that are employed by the artists to make candid confessions about the confusing state of being artists in the era of no absolute values and reveal a process of thought towards art activities. The ways through which the two artists create their works seem to point to disparate directions that cannot be matched under the frame of ‘title match.’ However, the different elements employed by the two artists generate meanings in a certain structure. Presented together within the framework of Title Match, Gimhongsok and SEO Hyun-Suk’s works build multi-dimensional collaboration.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a class='fr-file' href='/common/fileDownload?FILE_NM=20190705101241_c2280294220444acbf8197069c557e3d_779e05c1ac11408487fd783a025a23f6&amp;FILE_ORG_NM=2019+Title+Match+SEO+Hyun-Suk+Time+Table.jpg&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' target='_blank'>2019 Title Match SEO Hyun-Suk Time Table.jpg</a></p><p><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190705100718_35910d4db6c345ea9c23ff2f23ec124e_734c052f68f449278f6f98b4579082df,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=396369,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

In the world of objects that we have accumulated, five artists of the millennial generation ― Ahram Kwon, Kim Kyoungtae, Heejoon Lee, Choi Goen and Hoh Woojung ― explore matters that surround them through their work. Here, the objects themselves and the way the artists choose and deal with such objects are inevitably and inseparably linked to political, social, economic and cultural discussions.</p><p><br></p><p>With advancement in transportation, information and communication, national boundaries are collapsing in all areas such as finance, trade, scientific<s>&nbsp;</s>technology and culture, and the world functions under one single system. It is a globally integrated capitalist era, where the whole world operates under economic power and innovation and changes are demanded boundlessly. The ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ are intertwined in the constant stream of digital information, confusing our lives even more as we strive to merely keep up with the present moment. In this age of uncertainty, we often lack the means to solve problems at hand, let alone predict and cope with the future. Contemplating on such issues, this exhibition examines how insignificant and trivial objects reflect this age of so-called globalization and informatization, and aims to bring us to a closer understanding of contemporary life and art.</p><p><br></p><p>Choi Goen (1985)’s installations of disassembled and reconstructed domestic appliances and sculptures based on computer monitor forms reflect the nature of objects in post-capitalist globalized society, equipped with modern technologies and latest trends to arouse the infinite sense of lack and desires in human. Ahram Kwon (1987) sheds a critical light on the illusions and power of the digital media world, through her installation works in glass, a screen material used in computer monitors, tablets and smart phones. Kim Kyoungtae (1983)’s IKEA furniture wrapped in marble adhesive sheets are photographed, then edited to look flat, referencing the way an image is produced, consumed and distributed in the digital age, and how reality, illusion, truth and fiction are blurred in the life in SNS. Heejoon Lee (1988) also appropriates the way the image is generated and presented in the digital age. His abstract paintings that edit and reconstruct landscape photographs reflect the superficial lives of people today who busily traverse across the real and the virtual worlds. Lastly, the abstracted forms of diverse objects by Hoh Woojung (1987) portray anxiety in our life coming from numerous social issues as a consequence of the rapidly-changing technology and overflowing information.</p><p><br></p><p>The five artists in the exhibition unveil social issues in their everyday practice, by gathering up the ordinariness of the everyday objects around them, only to make them uncanny in their own way. In such age where new phenomena and problems are constantly occurring with everything changing so rapidly, the interdependent relationship between the digital network and the massive mesh of globalization is inevitable. While we may not be able to revert such progress, what is indeed needed at this point in time may be to stop taking daily life blindly as it is, truly sense reality, and be conscious and stir up changes for a better life.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190702170131_a982e6ff650642faa7c9eaed0cea6153_1f6ebe2c12e8447686c4c90ef513430d,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=395588,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

As a dancer and choreographer, Eunme Ahn has continuously produced and performed new works. This year she celebrates her 30th anniversary as an artist.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then, is <strong><em>Eunme Ahn_Known Future&nbsp;</em></strong>a retrospective exhibit on the past thirty years? The answer is both affirmative and negative. This exhibition is designed to be an appreciation of the contemporary artists who have collaborated with her and the active audience who have supported her as well as a celebration for the discussion on our future and its direction.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since her first individual performance as an independent artist in <strong><em>Paper Steps&nbsp;</em></strong>in February 1988, Eunme Ahn has abandoned the practice of the Korean dance industry, which followed the Western style and methodology of dance and emphasized beautiful gestures, and has attempted the adoption of non-dance movements. Eunme Ahn had no fear in blending the discourse of Korean traditional dance with the discourse of Western modern dance.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1990s, which includes the early days of her work in Korea and the period of her residence/activity in New York, she experimented with and pioneered the dance language of postmodernism that goes beyond the phenomenological existence through themes based on social realities, collaborations with artists in other genres, active use of original colors and objects, and stages that embody visual images. This period can be summarized as “the Koreanization of postmodernism, and the postmodernization of Korean dance.”<br>&nbsp;<br>In the early 2000s, during which she took office as Artistic Director of Daegu City Dance Company and produced a masterpiece, she pioneered the field of Korean-style Tanztheater following the model of Pina Bausch’s “Tanztheater,” which sought to restore narrativity through combining dance and play. However, Eunme Ahn was not complacent about attempting and realizing the Korean-style “Vernacular Tanztheater.” &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As a dancer who inherited the spirit of “Futei Senjin,” Eunme Ahn made a great methodological leap in<strong><em>&nbsp;Let’s Go</em></strong>, which was first staged at the 2004 Pina Bausch Festival. Individual elements of her choreography were specific non-dance movements, which were repeated, varied and constructed in order to move toward the world of abstract order once again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since 2011, with grandmothers, adolescents and adult men as her object of inquiry, she experimented ? as a Korean-style response to the postdramatic theatre ? quoting and realizing their existence on stage. In <strong><em>Dancing Grandmothers</em></strong>, Eunme Ahn collected the body language of people and put real people on stage, juxtaposing and blending them with her choreography based on her research. The choreographer made the following comment about such change. “For the last twenty-five years of doing works for the stage, I have expelled something and appealed to the world. But now, I wanted to do something opposite.”<br>&nbsp;<br>Intended to be both retrospective as well as explorative of the future, <strong><em>Eunme Ahn_Known Future&nbsp;</em></strong> consists of paintings, installations, videos, sounds, stage performances and archive materials based on thirty years of creative work. Nevertheless, individual elements are only raw materials, while the real essence lies in the audience participation that conforms to the post-white-cube museum.<br>&nbsp;<br>To put it simply, the trajectory of Eunme Ahn’s works over the past thirty years becomes a stage off the stage, and the gestures of everyone who visits the museum become the art. Eunme Ahn wishes that the education program of the art museum will not just be an annex to the exhibition but will itself become modern art and create the time and space for the delay of problematic judgment. She hopes that through active participation we can encourage each other to discuss and advance toward the future. Eunme Ahn argues that these activities represent “the process of giving dance back to people.” Is she hoping that through her functioning as a spirit or link, a cultural project that overcomes limitations of the reality will be implemented?<br>&nbsp;<br>Seoul Museum of Art expects the audience to create a new order and disorder with Eunme Ahn and make the most of the situation for self-directed learning as they go on stage within Eunme Ahn_Known Future, an exhibition more than just an exhibition. It also aims to cast light upon the artistic world she has unfolded over the last thirty years and her intended “research on the interconnections and media of reality that possess the possibility of transforming into art. &nbsp;?Chungwoo Lee (Art &amp; design Historian)</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em><span style='font-size: 24px;'><br></span></em></strong></p><p><strong><em><span style='font-size: 18px;'>&nbsp;This is Eunme Ahn</span></em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>This is Eunme Ahn&nbsp;</em></strong>is a series of performances and lectures organized by Eunme Ahn for the goal of eliciting motion within the audience.

Within the relatively solemn and rigid space of an art museum, the workshop offers a time of endowing our individual bodies with new senses.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>3) Group Lesson: Tap Dance<br>Facilitator: Jo Seong Ho&nbsp;</p><p>This is a class for learning some simple steps using tap dance, and it adds a pleasant twist to the simple footsteps of daily life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>4) Dance for Everyone with Ambiguous Dance Company<br>Facilitator: Ambiguous Dance Company (JANG Kyeong Min)&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Putting aside the stereotype that modern dance is abstruse, this class shares, learns and plays the “dance” that we can easily find around us.

Through the rehearsal of <strong><em>Geosigi Monologue&nbsp;</em></strong>that take place in the exhibit, the audience can observe the other side of the stage.

The tap dancers take part in the performance on an impromptu basis, dancing to the piano. This artistic culture is called “jam”, and it is a small-scale party that tap dancers enjoy, sharing each other’s rhythm, style and stage presence.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>3) Rehearsal for an Upcoming Performance,<strong><em>&nbsp;Fifty/Fifty</em></strong><br>Facilitator: Ambiguous Dance Company (JANG Kyeong Min)&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Fifty/Fifty</em></strong>, a performance scheduled for November 2019, is about the two faces of human. The rehearsal aims to show the process of producing a performance, the site of preparation and the effort of the dancers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4) Learning<br>Facilitator: Park Bum Tae</p><p><br></p><p>A performance that is put on stage can be thought to begin at the very moment when the singing, dancing, music and acting needed for the performance are learned. In Learning, Park Bum Tae illustrates the process in which Korea’s traditional art is passed down, in an attempt to reflect the patience and effort that are required but often hidden behind the splendor of performance.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>5) ”<strong><em>Japga</em></strong>” with Heemoon Lee<br>Facilitator: Heemoon Lee</p><p><br></p><p>We often only think of “<strong><em>minyo</em></strong>” (folk songs) when it comes to Gyeonggi songs. However, alongside these folk songs, songs called “<strong><em>japga</em></strong>” have also existed. Whereas minyo is sung while standing, <strong><em>japga&nbsp;</em></strong>is sung while sitting. While<strong><em>&nbsp;minyo</em></strong> is public-oriented, japga is art-oriented. True evaluations of Gyeonggi songs and Seodo songs in the past were made through<strong><em>&nbsp;japga</em></strong>. How well a singer can sing<strong><em>&nbsp;japga&nbsp;</em></strong>was an important factor in the assessment of his/her competence as a singer. For three days on September 17th, 19th, and 20th, Heemoon Lee’s<strong><em>&nbsp;japga&nbsp;</em></strong>practice room is set up in Seoul Museum of Art.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>[Mouth Dance]</p><p><br></p><p>1) Eunme Ahn_Known Future X MIJIHAENG Open Lecture: New Times, Diverse Community</p><p><br></p><p>Jul. 6: Lee Young June (critic, writer of<strong><em>&nbsp;Critique on Machines</em></strong>)<br>Jul. 13: Sang Wook Kim (physicist) &amp; Don Kyoon Hahm (literary critic)<br>Jul. 20: Chungwoo Lee (a.k.a Geun-jun Lim, researcher in art/design theory and history)<br>Jul. 27: Slavoj ?i?ek (continental philosopher) &amp; Taek-Gwang Lee (culture critic)<br>Aug. 17: Dongwoo Yim (architect)<br>Aug. 24: Haegue Yang (installation artist)</p><p><br></p><p>This open lecture series reflects upon “the present” as a period of civilizational transition in order to understand the present age, gain insights into the coming age, and seek creative questions, values and practical ideas.

All together 95 artists.",,"<p>The museum’s permanent collection and its present status at the Seoul Museum of Art</p><p><br></p><p>In 2019, works in the permanent collection of the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) totaled 4,913 in number. Starting with its very first collection, '<em>Korean Residents in Japan(4)</em>' (1985) by Park Saeng-gwang, collected in early 1985, the museum currently has approximately 5,000 works in its collection. This yearly introduction of new acquisitions in the form of an exhibition demonstrates what collection means to a museum, and '<em>Multi-Access 4913'</em> is an attempt to present the overall nature of the museum collection on top of its new acquisitions. Just as newness is generated through history, it’s essential to look at the present state of new acquisitions by ruminating on the past and analyzing the collection’s existing works in order to explore the history of the collection in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>In 2018, SeMA acquired 162 works (139 purchased and 23 donated). '<em>Multi-Access 4913'</em> regards the storage of the museum where the collected works are kept as a mechanism of storage, and is organized to access that medium from multiple angles through the archive, exhibition and screenings. '<em>Multi-Access 4913'</em> takes off from the conventional notion of a new acquisitions exhibition as a routine annual display of the museum’s new collected works. Rather, its purpose lies not only in presenting the newly collected works, but also in the general organization of the collection to function as a mechanism of the museum’s history and memory, as well as in the expansion of the ways through which to ‘access’ the collection.</p><p><br></p><p>First, the archive room, which shows the overall nature of the museum collection, holds materials that categorize history by the period/genre of the work, as well as its year of acquisition and year of production. This space functions as the background on which speculations on the history of acquisitions to come take place and the future plan is drawn. In addition, it becomes a site where the relationships between the newly acquired works and the existing works in the collection are formed. For reference, the standards for classifying the genre of the archive material is based on the ‘work category (Korean painting, Painting, Drawing &amp; Print Media, Photography, Design, Calligraphy, Sculpture, Installation, New Media, Craft)’ according to the ‘Seoul Museum of Art Collection Organizing System’.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In particular, the ‘Design’ category was first created in the museum in 2017 with the receiving of a work donated by Ahn Sang-soo, but has become exempt from the genre category due to the lack of sufficient data for analyzing the age. ‘Calligraphy’ and ‘Craft’ are genres established through the museum’s acquisition of most of the works that were exhibited in '<em>Seoul Craft Exhibition'</em> (1991-2000) and <em>'Seoul Calligraphy Exhibition'</em> (1993-2000), for the stable operation of the museum. However, the two categories do not demonstrate a historical continuity and are thus difficult to be analyzed based on linear history; therefore, the two categories were not included in this project.</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition and screenings introducing the new acquisitions from 2018 reject art historical style and thematic composition; instead, the works are presented as a symbol, installed in the order of organizing number, or the unique code given to the work when it was brought into the museum storage. Such a method seemed suitable for an exhibition introducing a large number of the collection’s works in the sense that it allows the audience to browse through the works in a more liberal way without being pressured to understand the theme of the exhibition.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>'Multi-Access 4913'</em> reflects on the museum’s collection, which went through a continuous process of self-redefinition in SeMA’s efforts to establish its identity, from its periods of experimentation and exploration, to expanding its practice through exhibition planning and implementation of educational programs. Just as the museum must continue to ask what role it must play in order to continue to exist, this exhibition explores such questions by presenting screenings of new acquisitions based on the organization of the existing collections. Tracing back on the history of the museum and writing the history of the new acquisitions are fundamental processes in demonstrating how “an outstanding collection provides the framework for all exhibitions through which the establishment of the museum is formed and changed.” By calling forth the museum’s collection, '<em>Multi-Access 4913'</em> is a new endeavor to write the history of tomorrow, together.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Seolhui Lee (Curator, Seoul Museum of Art)<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190424180317_cc0a2cea80fb46cd8f31f3405da949b8_d29dd961030c42649bf545498f614943,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=365900,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

If the spatial sense in the painting is constructed so that the two-dimensional composition can be seen in three dimensions by using the difference in physical size, saturation, and contrast, Yoo visualizes the three-dimensions in two dimensions through the manipulation of expanding sizes and fitting the angles so that flatten the boundaries of space as if we are looking at the screen.  Especially, we will make a new type of education as a creator of visual arts through a series of processes that spectators and children draw, construct, take pictures and own their spaces by utilizing the experience space created in Children’s Gallery 2.","<p>Hyun-mi Yoo’s oeuvre explores new visual art practices which blur and integrate the realms of two-dimensionality and three-dimensionality, time and space, as well as the boundaries between painting, sculpture and photography. This exhibition presents diverse forms of visual illusionthroughout the exhibition space that are inspired by the artist’s series of drawings, providing a unique opportunity to experience the gap between visual and spatial perception.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>In the history of visual representation from painting to photography andcontemporary media technology, the desire to achieve three-dimensionality on two-dimensional surface sparked a wide range of techniques that attempt to capture reality in its most subtle details and the most dramatic illusion possible. If painting attempts to capture three-dimensional space onto flat surfaceby controlling the perspective, color and brightness of the image, Hyun-mi Yoo reverses the process and flattens the three-dimensionality of the exhibition space to create an illusion of a two-dimensional, screen-like image.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Through her work, the artist attempts to providethe viewers with an experienceof walking into a painting, much like Alice entering into<em>Wonderland</em>. Just as the protagonist in Yoo’s earlier work, <em>A Man Who Became a Painting</em>, the viewers engaging with the artwork will feel as though they are suspended on two-dimensional surface. By recreating the sensory experience ofour video and mobile environment in real space, and by allowing the viewers to experiencethe space in reality far from reality, Yoo’s work playfully reflects on the conditions of the digital landscape we live in today.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, the special activities section located inside Children’s Gallery 2 invites children visitors to draw, reconstruct and take photos of the exhibition space, and through the process, encourages them to experience a new learning process in becoming visual art creators.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190405162826_8fe30f3ac98f49ff9fbc7ae711b98753_ed29870451344986b587167505e7a4aa,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=355939,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

He was born in Bradford, UK in 1937 and attended Bradford School of Art and the Royal College of Art, London, before going on to make some of the best-known images of the last 60 years. Since his first retrospective exhibition at London’s Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1970 when he was only 33, Hockney has continued to attract widespread critical and public attention.<br><br></p><p>Drawing on many different sources including popular imagery and the works of old and modern masters, Hockney’s subject matter concerns the traditional themes of art ? still life, portrait and landscape ? and his principal obsession about representation and perspective. He has been consistently innovative and adventurous in questioning how we look at the world and depict it in two dimensions and has demonstrated a range of possibilities in his work, not only within the traditional areas of painting, printmaking and drawing but his more recent use of photography and digital technologies.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Spanning his career from the mid 1950s to the present, this is Hockney’s first survey exhibition in South Korea. Drawn primarily from Tate’s collection in the UK as well as other international loans, it follows Hockney’s remarkable journey through the myriad ways he has interrogated the nature of looking and representation from his days as a promising student to his place as one of the finest artists working today.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ticket information :</strong> 1899-0042</p><p><strong>Melon ticket&nbsp;</strong><a href='http://ticket.melon.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><u>ticket.melon.com</u></a></p><p><strong>Exhibition information :</strong> ARS 1833-8035</p><p><strong>Group docent :</strong> 02-323-4501&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' style='width: 100%;' src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20190628192213_813c45854a344949a483c285126315ea_fe108a0261dd48ec9645ed899a0f5ebd&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' data-name='데이비드 호크니전_관람료 정보_영문0626.jpg'></p><p><br></p><div class='sponsor_logo'><ul><li class='long'><span class='tit' style='line-height: 150%; font-size: 8px;'><strong>Oranized by</strong></span> <a href='http://sema.seoul.go.kr/' target='_blank'><img class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20190319175857_55913ac61d23485e87f03076f61f1dad_34c293a69939479ca9fcc6b50bbc3314&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' data-name='01.png'></a>&nbsp; <a href='https://www.tate.org.uk/' target='_blank'><img class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20190319175900_78d263a1565b4328aab680e928ed677f_ff00919be2d04fc98676bd3cd726f6d9&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' data-name='2.png'></a></li><li><span class='tit' style='line-height: 150%; font-size: 8px;'><strong>Exhibition Management</strong></span> <a href='http://siwallcompany.cafe24.com/?page_id=31' target='_blank'><img class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20190319175904_ae0729f9c7fd498684d3fe9ad1c21ca8_36357ef2a77347868d20ff1e6174a862&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' data-name='3.png'></a></li><li><span class='tit' style='line-height: 150%; font-size: 8px;'><strong>Sponsored by</strong></span> <a href='https://www.britishcouncil.org/' target='_blank'><img class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20190319175908_ae46865e890846a9b1321ba45344627d_dbcfe8ba670b4acc995fad47a227754e&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' data-name='4.png'></a></li><li class='long'><span class='tit' style='line-height: 150%; font-size: 8px;'><strong>Supported by</strong></span> <a href='https://www.facebook.com/kakaopay' target='_blank'><img class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20190319175911_51f92dd8f8a84df6a5adac058b17c58b_0d28fbffd68a49f69a12e2d5e8000bf4&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' data-name='5.png'></a>&nbsp; <a href='http://www.seoulmetro.co.kr/en/' target='_blank'><img class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20190423132724_50ee38c6ffe84b8eabc66c85d4025405_890ef649e36745c8800a61fb0e9e6720&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' data-name='aaa.jpg'></a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p></div>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190320110511_1ac10f9eafe849ef9d647d3d2bfe8664_ab3b5a7d97794b61938b43bd3c0f5453,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=351459,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

With the emergence of the internet, the 1990s and the 2000s marked an era when artists actively began to explore the roles and rules, as well as the possibilities and limitations of the new medium. WEB-RETRO aims to revisit this period and reexamine how artistic practices have been transformed by the internet over the years. Considering the unique characteristics of internet art, the exhibition explores the medium in three aspects ? “How did internet art look at the society and engage itself with it?,” “How did internet art reflect the cognitive changes in the meaning of individual existence and image?,” “How did internet art expand the boundaries of art in its time?”&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In response to these questions, the exhibition introduces the following categories of artworks. The first is a group of works which utilized cyberspace as an alternative space for expression and a strategic media outlet by way of social intervention, or critical response against the society by revealing its hidden aspects. The second category looks at artistic experiments that redefined conventional artistic medium and explored new realms of expression made possible by technologies such as screen images, virtual reality, real-time remote control, and etc. The third group represents those works which embraced the open environment of the internet where anyone could become a creator, and where underground cultures and active communication flourished in both commercial and public realms.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In addition to the artworks, WEB-RETRO presents an online archive project which links important, historical works of internet art on the website, as well as an offline archive which traces important chronologies and events in the technological, social and cultural developments of the genre. Moreover, the exhibition includes a special restoration project for those artworks that could no longer be exhibited due to their outmoded technology. Collectively, the archive projects aim to introduce the wide range of artistic attempts in internet art from both the Korean and international art world, and construct a comprehensive topography of their historical, cultural and technological context. By providing such long-term, broad perspective of the genre, the archives hope to build a foundation for further in-depth art historical research by identifying the critical periods and characteristics of the genre.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>WEB-RETRO not only hopes to provide an important starting point for art historical research on internet art that is yet to be established in Korean contemporary art, but also to <span lang='EN-US'>address the issues of its conservation and collection, and to provide an opportunity to deeply contemplate the potential possibilities of post-internet art today.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190322141405_d959462e26034b058fa6d2db44a1761e_6bf993ada8154185962c0038a81910c9,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=352859,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
953272,426,ZERO GRAVITY WORLD,,Nam-Seoul Museum of Art,2019-03-01,2019-05-26,,,,,,,10,,,"<p>'Zero Gravity World' is an exhibition designed to commemorate the March 1st Movement’s 100 years of history and to view the significance of the Movement from a different angle, in terms of world history and contemporary art. This exhibition is planned in an attempt to transcend the limited interpretations of the Movement within the category of binary relativity between Korea and Japan, and to shed light on our history from the international viewpoint of cosmopolitanism. The significance of the March 1st Movement in the context of world history is fully confirmed with evidence that attests to the correlation between the Movement and other overseas national movements in India, the Philippines, Southeast Asia and the Arab world, with China’s May 4th Movement serving as an intermediary. This was the starting point of the exhibition, which considers the March 1st Movement as a part of a global movement against imperialism and as a part of the human rights movement that has continued throughout world history. In addition, the academic background of the exhibition includes the significance of cosmopolitanism that fought against any type of discrimination based on race, social status, or individual wealth while positively responding to historical progress, and the concept of postcolonialism that actively attempts to overthrow the culture of colonizers in a critical manner.<br>“Zero Gravity World” is based on cultural studies that are centered around efforts to restore the culture of the groups of people who were largely ignored in history because they refused to follow traditional norms based on social or and inequality. Most notably, the methodology of research concentrates on the life of the ruling class such fully reflects the spirit of the March 1st Movement. Based on the above mentioned criteria, six overseas artists, who are working as a starting point for each country, are selected and invited to the exhibition from around the world such as South Africa, Turkey, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam and Denmark. As opposed to the diversity of their nationalities, the artists have in common the fact that they focus on their own microscopic stories that cannot be fully narrated in the grand discourse. These artists voluntarily become others and minorities in their artworks. This exhibition pays particular attention to not only various factors that can overthrow dominant ideologies, but also show their identities using unique characteristics that only they can express under their different governance styles. The desire to escape and dynamism that develops in each writer’s language will open a window into the reinvention of various historical events. It is our hope that the exhibition of “Zero Gravity World,” narrated by artists from different countries of the world in their own artistic language, will become an opportunity for further research on the March 1st Movement, not from the traditional perspective of world history revolving around great powers, but from the perspective of mankind’s continued progress.<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220219095319_907d946586fe49c99a32fae0ff34dd45_073ba9988feb4b708789b9db5c8a48c5,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=953272,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
355495,425,2019 Seoul Focus Nothing Twice,,Buk-Seoul Museum of Art,2019-02-26,2019-06-09,,,,,,,,,,"<p style=''>&nbsp; &nbsp; SeMA, Buk?Seoul Museum of Art is pleased to present &nbsp;2019 Seoul Focus : <em>Nothing Twice</em> as its first exhibition of the year. Everyyear, Seoul Focus selects a central theme which reflects the current trend of contemporary art and expands on the museum’s identity as a community?oriented institution. This year’s exhibition examines the disruption of the global ecosystem and human life, explored through the language of art.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Capitalism’s endless pursuit of profit and short?sighted drive for growth are not only creating fissures in the global ecosystem, but also threaten the survival of many of the planet’s species, including humans. The air and water we breathe and drink are already contaminated with fine particles, while abnormal weather conditions have become the new normal. These symptoms of catastrophe clearly indicate that the planet has surpassed the limits of its capability for self?recovery. The development of technology and globalization driven by mankind has aggravated this disaster to epic proportions that go beyond national borders and continents. The likelihood of a major catastrophe, which is rapidly increasing, has already become our reality. Today, as we enter a new geological era defined by the global ecological changes brought on by humans, this exhibition questions how we will face this catastrophe of our time and what we must do to ensure survival for all species.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This exhibition examines a diverse range of aesthetic attempts which seek to bring about change to the current global ecological crisis, and introduces them in three different layers. The first includes artworks that contemplate diverse perspectives and modes of thought on that which has been consumed and wasted in today’s neoliberalist society. The second examines artistic practices and attitudes toward life that escape anthropocentric thinking and seek different ways for all species to coexist on Earth. Lastly, the third layer imagines a new type of community in which people unite and maintain free?form relationships to address and resolve issues in order to bring about change amidst crisis. It is ultimately where these three layers overlap with one another that we can glimpse into the possibilities of simple yet significant approaches to sustainable life. Here we can also witness the playful and festive vision of the Millennials, which sets them apart from the public campaigns of previous generations.</p><p><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2019 Seoul Focus begins with the issues of waste management, which started to gain much public attention last year, and aims to widen the scope of this discussion to examine the current ecological crisis, as well as the consumerism and capitalism that underlie all of these issues. The title of the exhibition, <em>Nothing Twice</em>, is inspired by the Polish poet Wisława Szymborska’s poem of the same name, which contemplates the fleeting meaning of life and existence through the individual stars that glimmer across the dark sky every night. Through such introspection on the finite nature and preciousness of life, this exhibition hopes to build a foundation for our efforts in restoring the damaged global ecosystem, and to provide an opportunity to address the crisis of our time while contemplating the possibilities for peaceful coexistence between humanity and the planet.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2019%2F&FILE_NM=20190328151906_91aa4c86e52a4afaa693c111b3055501_c39356d1794b41e3bb839e72f348b584,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=355495,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Fascinated by virtual shared systems and the role played by technology, his practice initially focused on issues pertaining international finance, value, currency in relation to trust and faith. More recently it grew to incorporate notions of future and forecast, across science and other disciplines. He incorporates elements of the invisible domain of digital in his works, in order to manifest that which is otherwise intangible; coded and data informed physical structures, so become a tool of investigation of the constant act of negotiation, that goes behind the system of information we call the tangible reality. His process is often collaborative and research based. So far he has worked with engineers and designers, with English and Chinese opera singers, data analysts, scientists, perfumers, economists, financial astrologers and fortune tellers. He sees collaboration as an invaluable opportunity to grow, explore and navigate the complexities of shared territories between apparently distant disciplines and rapidly changing systems.？Mirim Chu b. 1982, South Korea, lives and works in Seoul？Using design pixels as elements in her work, Mirim Chu engages in formative experiments that go beyond design and fine art. She critically explores keywords related to computer graphics, pixels, and the internet etc., and she has great interest in producing work where the cross-sectional aspect of images used in social network sites may be viewed from various angles. All her works, in particular, transform a visually hidden web-based society into a series of images, reflecting the artist's intention to directly present the digital landscape around us. As time passes, her perspective which looks at the life forms of the contemporary young generation gets brought out across a more diverse spectrum.","<p>In December, a month when people are most sensitive to recurrence and prediction, the Seoul Museum of Art will be arranging a forum for aesthetic criticism pertaining to contemporary society which tends to depend heavily on data and statistical figures.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>Two Pillars and Seven&nbsp;</em><em>Letters</em> is an art show that explores the nature and significance of the data that exists behind their appearance, moving beyond already exposed, pre-existing snippets of information.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The exhibition is designed to interpret the intentional logic of <em>Saju palja</em> (literally meaning “the four pillars and eight characters” or four pillars representing the year, month, day, and hour of one’s birth) which are used to tell the fortune of hundreds of thousands of people as a weak point of typical data in our society.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate goal of this exhibition is to reconsider contemporary society in which numeric information that draws keen attention (i.e. real estate prices, repurchase rates, and fluctuation of stock prices or bitcoin), fields such as astrology, and the four pillars of destiny are all predicated upon accumulated data and statistical figures which are only valid in limited cases and for certain purposes.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We may get a feel for the volatility of information the moment we encounter a work of art, going beyond the exhibit title and the surface of space.

On the other, it attempts to explore the close relationship between life, art, and politics that lies as the backdrop. The project aims to provide an opportunity to re-politicize the East Village’s issues that still remain valid to this day against the backdrop of our own reality. Such a journey, on the one hand, will hopefully take an overview of the political role of art while on the other, surpassing the temporal and spatial distance to share the experience that connects the past and the present, and establishing a platform for participation and engagement through sympathy.&nbsp;</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20181217170827_93c92735b111484c8c2fdfefe757603c_1521cbd83ccb428f947631e956f73fd6,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=299335,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

His painting is characterized by an exquisite fusion of brilliant primary colors and meticulous geometrical composition. He captured the infinite circulation of the cosmic energy in his canvas and constructed the futuristic space, boundlessly expanding and resonating out of the plane-surface.

In particular, the exhibition will examine the pure abstract work of the 1960s and print works of the 1970s, which became the basis of his geometric abstract works later on. The paper collages and works using paper brush and ink, which Han continued to produce after the 1980s, are interpreted as a transformed aspect of the artist’s later works. The drawings from the 1960s to 1990s, being introduced for the first time in Korea, also present a wider understanding of the artist’s art world.

As a result of such phenomenon, it is becoming increasingly difficult for us to communicate and understand each other, to escape the traps of commodification, and to identify facts and truth from the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>In this context, the exhibition probes the issues on three different levels. First, it reflects on the conditions of our society and the systems of communication to examine how the so-called “news” are being fabricated and distributed. More specifically, this section of the exhibition reveals both the desire and crisis of the Korean society through works that appropriate the content and format of news broadcasting, as well as the online comment culture. Exploring images and contents that <span lang='EN-US'>clash and collide with one another, the works portray the dark reality of how such fabricated contents are consumed in our society today.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>Second, the exhibition broadly examines how the images are created, distributed, and ultimately alter our senses in the current media and communication environment. The works in this section demonstrate how the human desire to be recognized by others feeds into the bubble of social media and personal broadcasting. At the same time, they question whether images created by AI and other algorithms are in fact designed to reinforce agendas and prejudices advocated by certain groups. Some of the works in this section also reveal a spectacle of images filtered through our online and media setting, appropriated by artists in the form of paintings and prints.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>Lastly, the exhibition looks into experiments on new ways of communication and the possibilities they present in the current age of post-truth. This section includes artworks which probe the issues such as human rights and the environment that arise from global political and military conflicts. They investigate the issues by incorporating methods of scientific research or reconstructing them in panoramic imagery. In both cases, the works collectively explore the boundaries of contemporary art and journalism to engage with the issues of our reality and to broaden the scope of our judgment. More importantly, they attempt to create social dialogue and inspire change.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang='EN-US'>In the sea of information that blinds us today, we must go back to the fundamental questions in order to communicate, understand each other, and to distinguish the facts and truth. We must ask ourselves how and what we will speak for.

This edition’s biennale theme is “Eu Z?n,” a greek language which means a “good life.” The biennale includes not only intellectuals from a broad range of fields such as art, economy, environment, politics, society and technology, but also aims for an exhibition that is open to the general public. In its attempt to maximize people’s access to culture and art, it aims to provide opportunities for a new social shift.</p><p><br></p><p>“Good Life” has been the most crucial point of reference for humankind in establishing its being. The specific content of a good life differs according to elements such as time, space and culture. Yet on the other hand, in those countless variations of the form of a good life, there are certainly common denominators to be found. Eudanomia, or in other words the flourishing life that develops through awakening the desires and abilities dormant in the human body and mind, could be named as the first denominator. The second common denominator is the fact that exploration based on endless discussions is necessary to grasp what a good life means to an individual.</p><p><br></p><p>Seoul Mediacity Biennale 2018 aims to explore and discuss with the multitude what this notion of a “good life” and to identify creative and future-oriented alternative values that are “Noch Nicht (Not yet), but already noticeable. Biennale participants are not confined to contemporary visual artists but include ”new practitioners“ such as activists, planners, researchers who demonstrate creative forth in different fields of life. The space Agora is installed in the middle of the museum’s 1st floor as a place where the public and the private matters intersect and people can discuss ”good life“ which is a political and public issue as well as an individual and private question at the same time. Through the whole Biennale, a great number of lectures, talks, performances will be presented centered around Agora.</p><p><br></p><p><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102212_89bee4f5af8942bb8da6faf3946ed673_25db6d83a1cb4fdab4204ae4cc176d9d&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programm_spread_cover1,2.jpg'></p><p>&lt;Agora as Medium&gt; - Namsoo Kim (Member of Directorial Collective)</p><p>From the very beginning until its 10th edition, the Seoul Media City Biennale has focused on creative relationship-building between media and art. While this relationship building remained a consistent theme throughout, changes that were by no means insignificant were wrought upon the exhibition concepts depending on the weight of these relationships. While the focus was accompanied by the larger trend of media art in the early- and mid-stages of the Biennale, more recently the emphasis has been on feeling out the fundamental possibilities of the medium itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Which is why, in this year’s Biennale, the significance of the medium itself will once again be explored under the ethos and concept “Eu Zen,” with the installation of a space and production of programs, Agora, within the exhibition gallery of the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA). This space will host lectures, conversations, discussions, and performances that will bring together the mythos, pathos, and logos of “Eu Zen.” Learning to live well―to learn well, act well, and play well―will be the thrust of Agora, where the meaning of the medium will be brought to reality.</p><p>&nbsp;While medium as a concept was featured previously in the 2014 Biennale as its third definition, the “psychic and shaman medium” that connects us to the other worlds, this Biennale edition will imagine the medium in the first meaning of the word, i.e., the empty space between several worlds. In this empty space, law and order are laid down according to the authority of the space itself that existed before any action or intervention by humans. Agora will contain the principles of this law and order and will function as an empty space where we can learn to live well. While this represents a rather substantial leap from the typical meaning of media art, the aim here is to rein in the concept of medium to a familiar and (in fact) refreshing territory, in keeping with the spirit of “being mindful of where you’re standing in.”</p><p><br></p><p><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102309_79794b017e214b969ac9535ffdfb9af5_8bbaeba069214c8db6ba98d18db7ec14&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programme_single5.jpg'></p><p><br></p><p><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102329_25a90499a85d44708adc0678f118495b_425d966fdb794f9dbaa3ed10a7e187d7&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programme_single6.jpg'></p><p><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102340_fa2f4c58abc24e3f91ddf62b778b68bc_3aa8e934ea9440e18e3c58af45028a7f&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programme_single7.jpg'><img src='/common/imageView?FILE_NM=20180908102349_009caa9b427245e9a3557f4c0f5a1355_a31e57ac37264e2b8ed766d289deb793&amp;FILE_TYPE=editor' style='width: 800px;' class='fr-fil fr-dib fr-draggable' data-name='programme_single8.jpg'></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180905104525_04202c1a1a174cef9e855332f8895f62_918bb37a23024c459290bc6fe705da85,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/series/detail?exNo=281541,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

After returning to Korea, he graduated in Sculpture from Hongik University’s College of Fine Arts. He then moved to the United States and received an MFA in Fine Arts from the School of Visual Arts, New York in 2011. Since 2012, he has had thirteen solo shows and participated in numerous group exhibitions around the world. Since his participation in the group show at Gallery Factory(2015) in Korea, his works have been shown at Nook Gallery (2017) and Art Sonje Center (2018). In 2016, a review of his solo show was featured in the internationally acclaimed art journal World Sculpture News, making him the sixth Korean artist with that distinction, joining others such as Kim Sooja (1996) and Sookjin Jo (2010). Currently, he is based in New York and works quite actively between Korea and Europe. Since 2012, he has had thirteen solo shows and participated in numerous group exhibitions around the world.

The title “Corner Dialogue” is an expression that integrates his artistic practice and attitude, where he departs from one point by reading a specific space and gradually makes a three-dimensional figure. The show is completed in the intersection of his thinking process on spacetime with the movements of the audience. Centered in the Project Gallery on the third floor, including the sunlit corridors, the space in front of the lift on the second floor with its many users, and the upper reaches of the lobby space, the exhibition extends outward to all parts of the museum.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Jong Oh is an artist who travels between many cities and countries with his tools and materials in a backpack, trying to create things along the way. The gallery is to him both a space for shows as well as a studio. His works, flexible while responding to the space with a mathematical approach, always result in experience. Accordingly, his practice is defined as site-specific installation or spatial drawing/installation rather than traditional sculpture. Taking the space itself as a material, the artist creates harmony and tension with understatement, and maximizes expression. Unlike other exhibitions, filled with artworks or objects, he primarily uses materials like thin lines, creating a non-physical space. Our gaze and senses are turned into something we haven’t recognized.</p><p><br></p><p>For this spatial project, the artist presents one of his representative works, Room Drawing. At the beginning of the <u>Room Drawing&nbsp;</u>series, he made works by erasing flaws found in the process of bringing or simplifying places or landscapes to the gallery space. Over time, he has developed the incorporation of the gallery space as a part of Room Drawing by taking these traces as a starting point for his work, or realizing the installation using particular forms of the space as raw materials. <u>Room Drawing (graduation) #1</u> is the result of dialogues that took place between the artist and the space at a certain time, using the architectural elements of the museum, the interior and exterior structures of the gallery space, and features of the environment. Having worked to break down the boundary between material and tool, for this exhibition, the artist makes a work of art out of a “folding ruler”, an essential tool for making works. Using this tool, he will measure architecturally interesting points such as windows, stairs, and corners of the museum and turn these into forms to be installed inside and outside of the gallery space.</p><p><br></p><p>In this way, with the movements of their bodies, the audience experience a space which is the outcome of the artist’s imaginative reinterpretation. Jong Oh invokes new unconsciousness, perception, and a sense of the space that surround us. The movement of the audience, which is an essential part of the works, creates another meaning among the gallery space, the works, and ourselves. The artist, who shows the spaces of the museum as the medium as well as the finished outcome, provides a maximized spatiotemporal experience, and ultimately challenges our recognition with respect to perceiving and seeing art.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>* The exhibition title “Corner Dialogue” comes from the book<em>&nbsp;</em>Float series 7(Hezuk Press, 2017) which documents the dialogue of the artist with the A4 size paper.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180626094416_289c2d0c2e744bde8927b6dbe0f075fc_3e737ec83c934a1691004caed243bb75,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=245289,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
231111,409,Voiceless - Return of the Foreclosed,,Seosomun Main Branch,2018-06-26,2018-08-15,,,Seoul Museum of Art,,,"video, installation, painting, photograph",33,"Sanghee Song, Erkan ?zgen, IM Heung-soon, Seoyoung Chang, Eunji Cho, Hong Soun, Hiwa K",,"<p>Seoul Museum of Art presents the special exhibition <em>Voiceless - Return of the Foreclosed</em> to cast light on the beings oppressed and excluded from our lives of this era, leading to a chance to deliberate on the problems of various areas around us.<br><br>These days, the concept of the postcolonialism is employed extensively and indiscriminately with its historical, social and political context removed. Yet the implication of the concept is quite different in the West and the non-West, or in the First World and the Third World. Colonialism as historical experience of the past and collective wounds persists by changing its form into actions of domination and ideology in exerting oppression and exploitation. Postcolonialism, understood as a practical discourse against colonialism as well as a series of psychological activities that attempt to recover the subjecthood functions in this exhibition as a mobile and flexible frame that references concrete situations of reality. Therefore, this exhibition departs from the acknowledgement of the complex context involved in postcolonialism as well as the awareness of the problematics according to it. Also, it aims to deal with the voiceless who are under all kinds of oppressive situations.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are named the so-called subaltern are not identified in terms of a simple dichotomous classification of the majority and the minority, or the dominant class and the subordinate class. Rather, they are excluded without anywhere to belong. Many contemporary artists make artworks as a method of exploring the potential for the excluded to speak up for themselves. This exhibition invites seven artists who have focused on the research on the subaltern, and suggests a way of re-reading the world by following the journey of the excluded.</p><p><br></p><p>Individual artworks that comprise the exhibition depart from concrete events or narratives that have happened or are happening under a circumstance of a particular space and time. Above all, this exhibition is itself a story. There are some things that go through all seven participating artists' modest stories generated among their works of embodying and unfolding the society's invisible reality: the common experience that is repeatedly developed all around the world beyond the local identities and distinctiveness in experience, and the artistic insight on reality. Therefore, the exhibition is also an attempt to produce a common story. The narrative of the exhibition departs from a story of a refugee as told by Hiwa K, an artist from Kurdistan, Iraq. The artist criticizes the system and ideology at work behind the scenes of individual events through a fictional character or the reconfiguration of the screen that recorded his whereabouts. The video with the harmonica sound amid the site of demonstration insists on the logic of resistance that art should speak of between artistic performance and historiography. IM Heung-soon's work that embodies the stories of people with the historical memory of the excluded and oppressed engraved in their bodies, and the work of Erkan Ozgen, a Turkish artist who deals with his era and social reality through an intense visual language find potential of artistic practice in the specific context instead of what lies in the transcendental. And they call for the politicality of a subject that derives practical discourses by rethinking the reality's conditions and build solidarity. Fragments of thoughts on the invisible being by Seo Young Chang incorporated the phenomena where temporality is reestablished within a relationship with the system based on the presupposition that the energy as a driving force behind life is structured by temporarily. The melancholic imagination that illustrates the experience of the individual body within the mechanism of repetition and circulation activates the dual structure where the ones excluded by institutionalized power does not disappear but return. The excluded from this structure returns in an unrepresentable way, uncovering the lack of those who exclude. Eunji Cho's work attempts to show the void where meaning is dislocated and to speak to the other. It also involves the gap that went unnoticed, without deliberation through knowledge. Hong Soun's work explores the possibility of ethical acts. It shows the equal segmentation of responsive ability and the responsibility toward the other while obtaining the opening of the being that carries with it the scene of compossibility. Eunji Cho's videos or Hong Soun's painting from a heterogeneous scene where the ones yet to be sutured or erased remain as something to return. The artistic reflection on the other and the question on the (im)possibility of hospitality cast a shadow upon Sanghee Song's work where present and past, light and dark overlap. As such, each image that is at the same time unfamiliar and familiar oscillates between artistic accomplishment and the social role of art, constituting a common story by being folded upon one another in resonance.</p><p><br></p><p><em>Voiceless - Return of the Foreclosed&nbsp;</em>aims to explore the social implications and potential of art. Each work deals with issues such as war, refugee, woman, death, etc. within a particular situation of the contemporary life at times directly, and at others indirectly through artistic metaphors. With the artistic attitude and ethics of representation obtained and brought about through different approaches, the artworks are questioning the value and limitation of art. 'What can art do?' 'How are we to deal with the problems involving ethical representation that is derived from the logic of artistic practice?'<br>This exhibition deliberates on these questions, eventually basing itself on the aesthetic project of exploring the potential of different ways of thinking through artistic potency as representing the unrepresentable. Such a critical awareness and the curatorial direction were brought to the table in May 26, a month before the opening of the exhibition, through a conference of the same title co-hosted by Seoul Museum of Art and Society of Contemporary Art Science. This conference consisted of the presentation of papers by Sohyun Ahn, Nara Lee, and Yung Bin Kwak, as well as a presentation of IM Heung-soon, one of the participating artists. Discussion on the paradox of dealing with the subaltern as the subject matter of art unfolded, followed by proposals of debatable interpretations on the ethics of art that connects to and engages with reality. Also, a time for aestheticizing and historicizing has been perceived as a common task. There exists an irony: the representation of the pain of the other that stayed in superficiality without being materialized could fall into a visual aestheticism. them, the situation where the audience appropriates it only with sensations follows. As such, the awareness of the reality that consumes disaster as the subject matter of art is the inherent irony of this exhibition as well as a critical and constructive reference.</p><p><br></p><p>It is the voice of the other that this exhibition is ultimately trying to share within the reciprocally referential understanding on conditions of life and art's (im)possibility of representation. It is when the sympathy towards the other is built that a space of hospitality and the restoration of the subject is possible. We hope this exhibition serves as a chance to ask oneself of one's own paradoxical position and to reconsider the subjecthood in one way or another while embracing artistic perspectives of reading and interpreting the world through diverse artworks.</p><p><br></p><p>The title of the exhibition - Voiceless - indicates being without voice, invisible and inaudible as they are excluded from the world. The subtitle - 'Star Shining upon Seven Seas' - is cited from the title of a novel by a Japanese writer Kanan Nanakawa which deals with the same themes as the exhibition in a broad sense. This exhibition is based on the affirmation of the possibility of a total freedom stemming from the very place of the return of the excluded as well as the potential of art as representation of the unrepresentable. Such an attitude toward the relationship of the excluded being and freedom is incorporated in the subtitles, 'Star Shining upon Seven Seas (in Korean)' and 'Return of the Foreclosed (in English)'</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180801152328_4d157d65ea5b4c7884e67b226cd2ae92_e57489f7b1964a9f81001567ea403e2d,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=231111,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Each individual subtly and varyingly reacts to and remembers the ever-changing weather while everyone commonly feels and thinks something.<br><br>□ Roland Barthes said, “There is nothing more ideological than what the weather is doing.” As an extension of this, a connection is formed with the weather within the wide spectrum of personal feelings and life, politics and economy, religion and science, the vicissitudes of civilization and the future of humankind.<br><br>This exhibition is an attempt to grasp the beauty of the nature that the weather presents us today and is a platform of our ongoing connection with weather. More specifically, it is a contemplation of the “taste” that we feel regarding the “weather” in this day and age that may be forgotten in the near or distant future.<br><br>□ The exhibition is largely divided into two sections, and elements related to the weather that are sensibly perceived were gradually, perceptually expanded and organized so that visitors can recognize them. “Tastes of Weather (Jung Man-young, Yeojoo Park, Byron Kim, Kim Yun-soo)” lets us appreciate the weather for what it is, a familiar constant that passes by in our everyday life. The instantaneous moments of the ever-changing weather phenomenon and nature evoke various feelings. “<br><br>Adding to the Tastes of Weather (Yusam Sung, Jungki Baek, Im Youngzoo, Hyungjoong Kim × Hwayong Jung)” takes a step further than the passively received weather phenomenon and focuses on its multilayered nature, as a phenomenon that has been encountering changes since long ago with the intervention of and its relationship with humankind. We hope that this exhibition will once again awaken us to the sense, sensitivity and thoughts about the weather not from a personal point of view, but from social dimension.<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220219094832_7cec34ba21f0452dad34bf0db58f4010_ac2b1255f0b54f5a9676e344065dc747,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=953240,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

To borrow Nietzsche's words, aren't the artists the ones with the ' worst eyes ' and ' worst ears ' in the world? The exhibition, organized by artists in Nanji residency, was therefore perhaps to be the work of blind people who gathered together believing impossible promises from the start.  To reveal the truth, the words we poured out, the data we searched for, the amount of food and drinks we ate and drank to seek faith spilled over but as the schedule of the exhibition was getting closer, many of our ideas collapsed one by one, people went away, and forms collapsed. Finding a spark of hope in Noah's ark to endure disaster and catastrophe was often thrown into blind faith, and compassion for the beliefs abandoned in the ark was also not thrown up. In the belly of the whale Jonah was locked we tried to fill with doubts about the reality that can neither die nor live and the irrational world, but the keen skills of survival, who were struggling to find an exit, leaked out as a faint hope.  This humble group of us marching toward the faith still did not give up and did not betray our original promise to stop each one's work and present only one collaboration. With relying on only that one thing, we decided to become a group of people who do not built the Tower of Babel, but make the net, and not to be seeker of form but to be a harvester of story. For this reason, in the Exhibition Hall 1, the Monologues of Jonah, we try to find secret confessions from those who could not find any faith in the world of frustration, distrust and isolation. And in the Exhibition  Hall 2, the Dialogue of Noah, we try to collect the action of our beliefs that can be kept open by engraving our dialogue, not searching the substance of our beliefs.     <br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>Opening Reception: 2018.6.7 pm5:00",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2F2018%2Fmgimg%2Fimg31%2Feng%2F&FILE_NM=pfile2018_1528699530618.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835260,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

In the capital city of Seoul, public design has met with many obstacles in the course of its reification, including the socio-economic paradigm focusing on the urban gentrification and development as well as personal interests of stake holders, thereby producing an excessive number of public structures of little aesthetic value.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><br></span></p><p><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'>This exhibition is grounded upon the understanding of public art as an expanded field. It holds that public art, in its comprehensive definition, includes every project to design and plan an urban environment intending to increase the value of the site. Recently, in the overall society’s paradigm has shifted: people seek for solutions to urban problems that have been generated by politics stressing urban development and gentrification. Instead, new emphasis has been laid upon the pursuit of sustainable socio-cultural development and the creation of pedestrian-oriented urban environment. Along with these changes, publics sites are reconsidered in relation to the characteristics of local communities. Deviating from the previous economical model of urban development, people shed new light on the value of aesthetic design in the public realm and people’s everyday life. In connection to the civil society’s interest in public art, the public awareness of such matters has brought about diverse alterations as to the social and institutional values, in terms of legislation and policy making.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'><br></span></p><p><span style='font-family: notokr-regular;'>By analyzing the diverse formal elements of urban public design making up the cityscape, the artists, designers, and organizations participating in this exhibition provide an opportunity for us to engage in a comprehensive dialogue with the field of urban public design from a different standpoint. With the participation of citizens and their support, we expect this exhibition to make contribution to the creation of new urban public design that is user-friendly (useful), aesthetically well-balanced (of aesthetical value), and socially responsible (ethical).&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180905104311_43b95e04f60441d89c935fbb9dbda876_295d8db441a34200a0573866393d5617,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=254419,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

This exhibition is designed to establish the bunker’s discriminative identity and serve as an opportunity for viewers to have new experiences with art by intentionally dismissing any historical approach to deem such a bunker as a vestige of dictatorship or the scars of war. Ever since the bunker was founded in 2005 when the Seoul Metropolitan Government began construction on the Yeouido Bus Transfer Center, the general public has accepted the universal concept of a bunker due to several policies based on our preexisting notions and assumptions. This exhibition, however, focuses primarily on the existential concept of a bunker and intends to shed light on the SeMA Bunker as an underground utopia.  The Seoul Museum of Art views the bunker from an interdisciplinary perspective that integrates architecture, archeology, literature, environmental planning studies, and psychology in order to establish its own ultimate ontology, keeping its traits pertinent to only the “underground.” Excavating a Neanderthal’s fossils or the remains of ancient Troy serves as an opportunity for us to interpret the act of digging in the ground as an epitome of cerebral explorations, thereby associating the underground with the discovery of truth. We normally bury all causes and effects in the earth when foot-and-mouth disease and the bird flu virus sweep the nation since such endeavors provide us with emotional stability. Underground structures are considered a preferred solution to destroying the ecosystem and the current environmental issues we face by virtue of this.   The ground for this is Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall, an ice hockey rink built underground for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. The emergence of similar underground buildings has positively contributed to the advancement of the construction industry and has been interpreted as a new resource of the material world, gaining legitimacy in terms of modern consciousness. The bunker, regarded as a secret space for only those who are chosen, comes into being with such a constructive background.  A bunker is usually interpreted as either a logistics base or a means for military operations. The SeMA Bunker, however, is differentiated from this definition. As the bunker located at the Yeouido Bus Transfer Center turned into a base to enjoy culture and art in 2017, it brought down those who were not considered when it was designed and refurbished. This point raises discourse on the new underground world the SeMA Bunker may have forged. This has the bunker work as a “superspace” through an overturn of each observer’s eyes while pushing beings and notions that are not involved with each other into an underground architecture. The audience isolated there will build their own utopia through their own dialectical thinking, facing a wide array of works.   The title, Instruction for the Audience is derived from Instruction for the Public Behavioral Strategies that guide viewers how to act in case of fire at the SeMA Bunker. It conveys paradoxical implications that the exhibition has to separate people who must follow the manualized evacuation method from the viewers who have to attain its completion as well as it introduced behavioral strategies for viewers to have new experiences while following presented coordinates. The exhibition declares an extraordinary artistic approach to take one step closer to our history and society. It is our expectation that the exhibition will serve as an opportunity for all visitors to the SeMA Bunker to gain their own artistic idioms.

The gallery exhibits materials related to the site to remind of its history and reexamine its past. At the same time, the gallery commissions video works that deal with SeMA Bunker and its archive. It is hoped that SeMA Bunker Archive Project transforms SeMA Bunker into a site for continued imagination and production and builds a new kind of archive which offers thoughts and ideas that will emerge in the coming time. SeMA Bunker aspires to achieve the goal by focusing on the future, rather than approaching itself as a mere depository of records and documents.<br><br>&lt;A Room without Mirrors&gt; pays attention to 'the absence of records' of the bunker discovered in 2005 and the consequent numerous 'assumptions'. It questions our approach to the interpretation of the bunker: we are apt to often personify the bunker whose purpose has been lost as an innocent political prisoner with dementia and pretend to believe something else is or could exist in it. The establishment that confines the bunker does not concede the situation in which the bunker has to exist in itself without a substantial purpose. Meanwhile, the establishment forces the bunker to be filled with the history of blank that has never existed in its memory flooded with meaningless records perhaps not directly related to it. Using the archival videos (news about it) and sound, Kwang-Ju Son portrays the memories that the bunker that is strange and void because its common significance has been lost. It is connected to the memories of the artist's childhood: he had to be born to the world, carrying the mission of the national restoration in the time when life lost its will and violence prevailed. &lt;A Room without Mirrors&gt; will undress our anxiety and unrest that we do not acquire autonomous existence and depth though living in the socially approved way of thinking and life and will present distinctive implications.</p><p>Blending a variety of genres and styles including drama, experiment, documentary, installation, etc., Kwang-Ju Son exhibits the video works across the boundary of movies and art in both domestic and international film festivals and art institution.

274868,401,GanaArt Collection: Regrettable Times,,Seosomun Main Branch,2018-04-24,2020-03-08,,,Seoul Museum of Art,,,painting etc,around 33,,,"<p>“Regrettable Times” is the second exhibition featuring the GanaArt Collection, which consists of 200 works of art donated by GanaArt Chairman Lee Ho-jae in 2001. Lee recalls his support for realist works was out of “a sense of responsibility as someone who was in the art scene at the time through the mid-80s”, indicating a sense of regret about those times that is vividly on display in these 200 pieces by 46 artists who struggled through Korea’s turbulent modern history. The collection includes 160 pieces by artists who actively led the Minjung Art movement (minjung-“the people”) which are appreciated as works that most intensely represent the spirit of those times.</p><p><br></p><p>With Seoul’s confirmation as host city of the 1988 Olympics and 1986 Asian Games in the early 1980s, the Korean Fifth Republic spurred development by focusing the energies of the entire nation on industrialization and urbanization. The so-called “3S” policy, which encouraged screens, sports, and sex, led to transforming everyday life and making it more colorful and glamorous than ever. However, the implementation of the appeasement policy was intended to distract the public from the lives and voices of the masses who suffered from inequality between the cities and the countryside, the harsh reality of national division, and unfair labor conditions, diverting the national desire for democratization into disinterest in politics.</p><p><br></p><p>In the midst of these historical currents, a voice of self-examination burst from inside the art scene on the persistent silence of modernist art about the ongoing situation, thus giving birth to Minjung Art. Young artists and art critics who were then in their 20s or 30s formed small groups and issued statements calling for the revival of figurative painting that reflected reality with a critical eye. The artists who took part in this exhibition led this Korean art movement which had sprung up spontaneously. In particular, a section at the center of the exhibition space will introduce artworks aimed at soothing a wounded society through collective sinmyeong in order to overcome reality. They achieved the unique aesthetic of Minjung Art by working out the pains of their time through collective sinmyeong or mass excitation, which is felt when staging energizing shaman rites, engaging in traditional folk dance, and participating vigorously in Korean folk performance groups. Sinmyeong, also meaning an energetic state in which one can easily overcome any obstacles, was also seen in artworks and hanging paintings (geolgae geurim) from the mid- to late 1980s, when the appeasement policy was lifted, and the struggle for democratization was extremely heated, thus driving the unfolding of a new chapter in Minjung Art. A 14-meter-wide hanging picture, “Story of the Painting Scene in the 80s” is the result of a collaborative effort by artists providing an opportunity to appreciate the greatest masterpieces of Minjung Art from the 1980s in a single glance. This permanent exhibition featuring the GanaArt Collection, one of the principal collections of the Seoul Museum of Art, should provide viewers insight into the Zeitgeist of the time and into Minjung Art, which was at the forefront in the transition of Korean modern art history, from multiple perspectives.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180816134116_5e0463c7daa3419189addbfc374e5356_544cbf36e051480c9196ca4918349116,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=274868,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The purpose of the exhibition is to open the museum collection to the public and provide the audience with a platform for reading trends in art historical research and contemporary art. For this exhibition, the museum analyzes the existing collection and enhances areas which are deemed insufficiently valued in terms of art history and genre, and annually purchases works worthy of contemporary value. Currently, the Seoul Museum of Art holds about 4,700 works of art in its collection, of which 188 were collected last year.  This exhibition of new collections is distinctly different from special exhibitions in which works are selected based on an established subject or concept. What is essential in constructing a certain form or composition of an exhibition of this personality, is to re-read and categorize history through the acquired works. Through this process, what is witnessed is how works of various subjects and diverse forms coexist, not in a singular landscape but in the intersections of multiple paradigms.  With such intent, the exhibition Heaven, Earth & Man introduces new works collected by SeMA in 2017. The title of the exhibition was borrowed from the video installation work Heaven, Earth &Man & #40;1990& #41; by Oh Kyung-hwa, which analyzes life in Korea from the historical, political, social and natural perspective, and captures artists confronted with such life. The title was appropriated to embrace the idea that the present state of art within the structure that surrounds us will always encompass constant variations in the countless correlations today as it has always done in the past.  The exhibition contemplates on three big themes ― Heaven, Earth, Man ― through 70 works of art in Korean painting, western painting, drawing, print media, photography, sculpture, installation, new media and craft. The works on the 2nd floor focus on the natural landscape inside and outside art, while the collection on the 3rd floor echoes with the resonance of the age, derived from history. While each frame demonstrates a specific aspect, they will also create a whole picture of contemporary art by relating to each other.  As an index of history and the present status of the art museum, the museum collection establishes its own identity. To this end, the annual exhibition of SeMA’s new collection proposes to facilitate the public understanding of the museum’s collection and hopes to read today through the rumination of yesterday. The collection of the museum is shown in various special exhibitions besides the new collection exhibition, and are also presented in foreign collaboration exhibitions with the City of Seoul, as well as in the SeMA collection lounge set up by organizations affiliated with the City of Seoul.  The collection of a museum is an invaluable material for faithfully identifying both a continuing history as well as the contemporary art scene. It’s also a keyword that suggests a vision for a future which has yet to arrive.

Still, all work related to embroidery, weaving, knitting and ‘thread’ was deemed as women’s work. In modern times, such a social perception was overthrown, and as embroidery and knitting began to be positively used as methods of healing or resistance against the existing structure of a society, its value has been reevaluated within the field of art.   In the meantime, the handiwork of women who worked with thread and textiles played a crucial role in industrial field. However, pertaining to economic significance, such handiwork was dismissed as subsidiary labor or leisure activity. In recent times, the value of handmade goods has once again been placed in the spotlight. A lifestyle enveloped in handiwork has been illuminated, and a movement to re-position the fundamental value of labor in such a lifestyle is in progress.   The exhibition with weft, with warp will take needlework, embroidery, weaving and knitting to approach visitors with strategic, creative methods or themes. Simultaneously, the exhibition will be composed of works exploring women and society, and this will form the base for a project that discovers the value of the future led by communities. This will shed light on artistic social activities that will break through existing boundaries such as those that exist between art and everyday life, craftsmen and artists, and professionals and amateurs.   Just as weaving is completed only when the weft and warp come together in harmony, this exhibition will be a valuable time to reflect on the balanced value of life and the social role of art.

This shows that the audience has become a ‘self-curating’ active agent by overcoming the attitude of ‘mobilized participation’ which was required of the audience until recently.

It shows how approaches to image-consumption and image-representation are related to each other in the real world, seen from the viewpoint of virtual reality, which is one of the major media of contemporary artists. The format of the exhibition has been designated by time and space, through which we can illuminate the methods of image-consumption and representation from diverse points of view.<br>The digital environment has changed not only the definition of artist, the artists’ thinking processes and their ways of recognition, but also the space of our everyday lives. As Shim, Hea-Ryun has mentioned, as digital space has transformed into the “alternative space of our daily lives,” connected time has dramatically increased, and we can now handle almost every daily task on the web. This provides a very crucial ground, upon which we can understand the forms and processes of the works of artists who were born in the 1980s. They constitute a generation of artists that does not take a dichotomous approach to any media, as they make no division between analog and digital. The condition of their media and the changed technological environment blur the border between the virtual and real worlds, which have functioned as the basis of artistic practices. Such an ambiguity has entailed the annihilation of practical instruments and methods that had been required for the production of art (e.g. a studio or workshop, shipping, and storage for artwork etc.) and finally led us to re-interrogate the realization of art in the real world, including our understanding of the meaning of artwork, the process of art making, and the appreciation of art.<br>Phantom Arm illuminates the rapidly changing creative environment through the widely spread internet and other science technologies, thereby exploring the ways in which such changes influence the method of artistic representation and evoke new artistic senses and thoughts. The artists of this exhibition, who is essentially based on digital media or their artistic environment, present how specific settings such as “account setting,” “non-spatiality,” and “oblivion and augmentation of body” affect and embody the works of art. The title of the exhibition Phantom Arm stems from expressions such as “phantom limb” or “phantom phenomenon,” the vivid yet pseudo bodily sensation that a person feels when it seems like amputated body parts are still attached. This show focuses on how the artists’ creative environment expands beyond the computer monitor as well as on the invisible mediation between the factors that form the artwork e.g. the bodily synchronization between the inside and the outside, oblivion, and augmentation. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Likewise, Phantom Arm applies the changes in the creative conditions and environment as the underlying background knowledge, upon which we can interpret works of art. Henceforth, we hope to discuss “the imaginary mapping between virtual reality and reality” (Kang Jungsuck), “the player’s body in the VR and Reality” (Gim Jeongtae), “imaginary drawings through patterns and memories” (Rahm Parc), “Googling image-searches and errors” (CO/EX), “the privatization of memories in the age of digital media” (Ram Han), and “collaborations with a second account” (Kim Donghee). By doing so, we will be able to explore various approaches to the exhibition and embody changes in the artistic environment and conceptions/perceptions of art today. With this exhibition, the Buk Seoul Museum of Art will function as a test field in which the virtual world can encounter the real world and audiences can experience an improvisational embodiment of virtual reality.<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220219094357_b139c09961f84f3b8794e4042c7d9b57_0352d4212251492a8b296b6df266a1dd,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=953216,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

This exhibition focuses on the expanded relationship between mapping and space, particularly in the city. Compared with natural spaces or rural areas, which are mostly located outside cities, the city is a contested zone, in and through which new modes of production, socio-political actions and relations are competitively generated, to seize a dominant position in exercising decisive force. In other words, the city can be a proper place to provide more chances to perceive and experience the transformation and conflicts of existing relations and systems in an encounter with new spatial rule and perception. In some countries, particularly South Korea, people tend to use the spaces of the city more actively than those of other countries, not only because over 50% of total population in South Korea are concentrated in the cities, but also because, in many cases, spaces are used simply as an essential means for earning more profits, such as competitive development, investment of residential and commercial places and the occupation and transformation of public spaces. Considering the complex spatiality and spatialization of the cities in South Korea, mapping cannot be understood from a single unitary perspective, as a space is not a fixed entity, but constantly produced and changed in its interrelationship with different forces, movements, relations and perceptions.  concerns ways in which mapping can act as new form of collecting, producing, coding, decoding, recording, (re)ordering and visualizing existing spatial knowledge and relations in and through the space of art; and how contemporary changes in perceiving and understanding the world alter the meaning and practice of mapping. The exhibition is structured in four different spaces, perspectives and methods of mapping the city. By developing the idea of mapping, these four artworks visualize specific aspects, moments or places, which have been forgotten, overlooked or invisible, covered with dominant powers and systems of urban space in South Korea.

The faces of art personalities such as artists, poets, novelists, film directors and actors from the 1970s to 2000s, captured by representative photographers such as Joo Myung Duck, YOOK Myeongshim, Koo Bohnchang, and Hein-kuhn Oh, form the center of this exhibition. Another axis of the exhibition in this time of universalization of photo media, represented by mobile phone camera and SNS, is not just to retro-illuminate the portrait of the artists, but to have an opportunity to contemplate on the meaning of the artist and the art in the contemporary art of & #39;here and now& #39; through the photography of young photo artists such as Kyungwoo Chun, Hyun-doo Park, Jeong Kyungja and Kim Moon. Lastly, through the archives & #40;handwritten manus, first editions, etc.& #41; of literary people prepared in one corner of the exhibition hall, we will look again at the altered meaning of art.

589,392,ahn sang-soo’s salm.letters.[letters.for.life.],安尙秀‘s 活-字.,"White Gallery, Xue Xue, Taipei, Taiwan",2018-03-15,2018-09-02,,,"Xue Xue Foundation, Seoul Museum of Art",,,,,,,"<p>This exhibition is initiated from Seoul Museum of Art for focusing on the pioneer of Korean</p><p>typography and graphic design history in Korea, Ahn Sang-soo. The exhibition is not only retrospective on Ahn’s unique and varied design practice from the ahn sang-soo font released in 1985 up to the letter works of present date, but also respectfully connecting his design philosophy weaved by varied activities including design publications, organizing cultural initiatives and the commitment to education through the Paju Typography Institute &amp; #40;PaTI&amp; #41; which Ahn has opened 6 years ago in the book city of Paju together with numbers of younger designers and educators in Korea.</p><p><br></p><p>Entitled as salm.letters [活字], this exhibition explores the works done by designer Ahn Sang-soo centered on letters. Ahn Sang-soo, as a representative designer in Korea, has always worked on creating and practicing around letters. To him, letters are “living organisms” or “living things”, just like the Chinese character 活 refers to. He believes that all the creations with letters, such as a book as a bind of letters, exist together in the net of a living universe hold by vast amount of knowledge and signs. The receiving procedure itself is however like “infusing life into a lifeless thing”. Ahn’s anguish and impulse, as an artist, however is probably approaching the transcendental sense of letters as pure images and experiments as they provide the ultimate resonance beyond the meaning.</p><p><br></p><p>This exhibition especially emphasizes East Asian letter culture as a key issue to bound the region closer with the spirit of harmony and inter-connection. The cultures of East Asia, including Korea, China, Taiwan and Japan, are tied by the common character we refer to as “Chinese letters”, but of course today the true nature of the letter culture bears a different status in each country. Chinese letters among others, which is located in the east of the Eurasian Continent, are based on a multi-level structure that has roots in hieroglyphic features. Therefore, they belong to a complicated semiotic system which does not fix the matrix. While simple Romanized alphabet type led to the creation of the Internet era, Chinese and Korean alphabets are still questioning on their suitability to internet settings, specifically within the issue of economical efficiency. The commissioned work, Tao de Ching tiles suggest us the future to typography and design in East Asian culture from the aspect of character systems and the most profound philosophy commonly shared in East Asian region. Ahn’s letters are probably searching for one undivided truth at the root of all things, just like what Taoism teaches us.</p><p><br></p><p>While Chinese belongs to “an isolating language” of a single morpheme system, Korean consists of polysyllables and belongs to the Ural Altaic “agglutinative language &amp; #40;characterized by application of postposition or change of affixes&amp; #41;”. At the same time, Korean is very complex, composed of about 1,000 syllables because the basic principle of “speaking” made the shape of the Hangul letters. In Room 1 at the White Gallery of Xue Xue, there are two different versions of Tao de Ching composed in two different language; Chinese and Korean, and they provide us a chance to face to the “difference” of these two languages. The concept of ‘difference’ itself is the core spirit of Korean language, Hangul when it was first created to be different than the Chinese domination in East Asian region of the time. The ‘difference’ has been also the indication for Ahn in his design philosophy, as well as it also provokes a similar way of creating symbols or logos; that we try to arrange it in a simple form to make it as functional &amp; #40;readable&amp; #41; as possible, but at the same time searching for the “redundancy” that might be connected with beauty, richer communication and ultimate resonance.</p><p><br></p><p>Departing from this living element within letters that is containing the source of life, the exhibition also explores Ahn’s past creations and activities. From opening the first internet cafe in Korea with his lifelong friend and sculptor gum nuri to his eight thousand plus collection of one.eye photographs, the designer is one of the most active Korean creatives in the global community. The clout of Ahn’s contributions to Korean typography has granted him numbers of awards including Designer of the Year from Design Magazine from as early as 1983, recipient of the GRAND PRIX from ZGRAF 8 in 1998, and the 2007 Gutenberg Prize. He continues to educate young designers at Hongik University, and this commitment on the education went further by opening the education cooperative and designers community, Paju Typography Institute in 2012. In addition, Ahn disseminates his radical innovations through the publication of the experimental art and culture magazine bogoseo/bogoseo [report/report], which he started in 1988, also with his friend gumnuri. In 2017, Seoul Museum of Art invites Ahn Sang-soo to appreciate his lifelong achievement and ongoing practice, and he then introduces a significant changes of concept with the series of new letter paintings, hollyeora &amp; #40;心流&amp; #41; [be immersed]. This series goes against the ‘Korean Modernism’ accomplished by the ahn sang-soo font when he pulled Hangul out from its entrapment in the frame of tradition of Chinese characters and evokes again the time of tradition of Chinese characters which had existed before Hangul was born. The letters become a kind of secret code and incantation that calls forth memories of a future that is soon to come. And this perception reminds us of letters containing something beyond the visible dimension and means of communication.</p><p><br></p><p>Ahn’s achievement and influence is variety and even infinite throughout forms of book design, editorial design, font design, logotype and poster design that are all centered by letters, as well as devoted himself on publication, writing and education. These numerous practice is actually rooted on the spirit of design itself, which connects arts with technology, and ‘poetry’ with the world. This spirituality and aesthetics of movement reminds us of the European art and culture history during early 20th century when modern design first came into the world. However, Ahn’s typography is not only limited in simple engineering and aesthetic issue. His typography is about designing a frame of liberation on human life and spirit throughout Hangul as the embodiment of ethnic and humane idea. We sincerely hope that the exhibition opens up varied access to connect with the spirituality of typography as an ultimate language of art.</p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2018%2F&FILE_NM=20180517105130_802ffe0c0cfd453eb41a19412d29f812_a4e64de656b344b6b841a4646d3701e4,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=589,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
953192,391,Drawing and Playing with Jackson Hong,,Buk-Seoul Museum of Art,2018-03-13,2018-08-19,,,,,,,,,,"<p>Buk Seoul Museum of Art has opened a children’s exhibition with the themes of “colors”, “dots, lines, and sides”, “rhythm”, and other concepts of form or shape. Buk Seoul Museum of Art, which has presented fundamental principles of form in turn through four exhibitions, invited artist Jackson Hong, a former automobile designer, to the children’s exhibition with hopes for a refreshing interpretation of design language.<br><br>What will artist Jackson Hong tell us about at the children’s exhibition?<br><br>With the theme of this exhibition being ‘a new attitude in looking at objects’, this is a fundamental topic of design as well as the very point that Jackson Hong seeks in his work. Whether art or design, an attitude of looking at one’s surroundings with unfamiliarity is required. If there is one difference to be noted, it is that an artist has unlimited freedom to create whatever he chooses, while on the other hand, a designer is given a specific subject, whether it be an object or a space. The artist who started off as a designer set off under the condition of designing everyday objects, creating, twisting, and modifying works that surpassed the scope of object design, and this exhibition can be seen as one that is connected to a broad use of surrounding subject matter.<br><br>‘Drawing and playing’ with the artist at the Museum of Art<br><br>Viewing objects differently is actually a fun exercise. Thus, the exhibition where ‘drawing and playing’ takes place incorporates a fun atmosphere. One piece of artwork that fills the exhibition hall and hallway is [Run, Pencil and Fly, Eraser!], which unfolds subject matter to stimulate children’s curiosities one by one, from a common fruit to a house with a roof, from ordinary objects such as a forklift to dinosaurs and ammonite that went extinct 100 million years ago. Each element includes various design techniques (perspective, projection, design, proportion, angle, drawing methods, etc.), principles that are not learning content that children are required to learn, but things that are naturally embedded into the play like the play tools that the artist brings to have fun discovering objects.<br><br>What is the message that the artist wishes to deliver to the children?<br><br>Another keyword for this exhibition is ‘drawing’. The artist calls [Run, Pencil and Fly, Eraser!] a kind of drawing project. The first scene that spectators see as they walk down the stairs is a set consisting of a pencil and an eraser?basic tools of drawing. One look at this new work shows that this is not even close to the common definition of drawing (expressing something by creating lines on the surface of paper), so why does the artist emphasize the meaning of drawing?<br><br>Designers develop their ideas by drawing over and over on paper or on screens. This exhibition can be seen as the ‘process’ of drawing in creating something new, together with the tender ideas and pure joy of discovery that is found in this process. [Run, Pencil and Fly, Eraser!] is the result of Jackson Hong’s survey and imagination of an apple and of a plane, and children can take after the artist’s methods of drawing and playing throughout the exhibition to enjoy and discover new sides of objects.<br>So then, shall we ask the children about it?<br>Hold the running pencil and flying eraser in your hands, and let’s begin the game!<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220219094012_68be26562fa946cfbcebb369091ecd52_9f1f06c3c5af449d8029b21479279db2,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=953192,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The starting point of this exhibition is the ideological avant-garde art of Latin America, which came into existence against the backdrop of the global rise of political radicalization, which occurred along with the French revolt of May 1968. However, this starting point is not merely a narrative of the particularities of the political events that were, and are still being, recorded in history, nor is it just a statement on the social significance and importance of the avant-garde movement of the time. The reason this exhibition is looking back on the avant-garde movement is to examine the points at which the historical proposition of the avant-garde movement, “integration of art and life”, becomes divided or ignited according changes in the existing social order, and to investigate the aesthetic methods by which art gains its vitality. The vitality of art can only kick into gear when art becomes a cultural and political comment on a society before being simply a beautiful material or practice. Therefore, this exhibition explores the complicated beauty deeply engraved in the sociopolitical context of the colonial modernity collectively experienced by the non-Western world, including Korean.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p>The various forms of the avant-garde movement triggered by modernization in the non-Western world, become decisive events in the forming of the “identity” of art by elevating the state of local art and its surrounding context to a more active level. In Latin America, the Conceptual avant-garde movement arose in various forms around the 1960s, a development that later became an important standard of measure for understanding “Latin American Conceptual Art”, or “Southern Conceptualism”, which is now well known to us. Meanwhile, Minjung Art in Korea, became combined with the struggle of the people during the turbulent period of the 1980s and sought after various forms of media and art, but is often evaluated as having failed to achieve the ‘universal language of art’ as it did not manage to connect with the Western practices of Conceptual Art. The political and aesthetic experiments of this time in Korea have therefore remained a yet unsolved issue of the regionalism of the time, in which art was practiced under the shadow of the West.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p>The 14 artists &amp; #40;team&amp; #41; invited to this exhibition, were gathered not because of their geographical status, but because they are conscious about problems related to the postcolonial perspective, subjectivity and the community, having passed through the experience of Western imperialism, cultural hierarchy, hybrid culture, and the history of modernization and dictatorship. Not all of the 30+ pieces of art invited here are direct remarks on this kind of local context. Some of the artists instead pay attention to the ethnographic beauty of “the indigenous people” that might be unfamiliar in the language of contemporary art, as well as the nature and object that are categorized under “culture”, while reflecting on and inquiring into contemporary art from within the world view that existed before the modern era.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p>Working for the Future Past is not an exhibition aimed towards the simple transmission of information about ‘another’ culture by enumerating the works and the artists of other regions. Instead, it proposes awareness of the real and unavoidable constraints and boundaries within which local art operates as the language of Western modernity and to “Latin America” as a way to cross these boundaries. Rather than a return to the uncertain past or promise of a dreamlike future, our aim is to use this exhibition as a mirror in the hope of finding a more appropriate path here and now. Profound understanding of these works will pave the way for us to enter the communal realm of “global yet regional art”.</p><p data-empty='true'><br></p><p><br></p><p data-empty='true'><br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_2a902d4e10654964a60bf0651f17cc03_c7143df463f844a9bf1150e80d238934,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=575,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Sanggye New Town, located in the Nowon-gu district of Seoul, began as a large-scale public housing project implemented by the Korean government under the military regime in the 1980s to solve housing shortage in the city. Sanggye New Town was not only one of the largest new town developments in Seoul, even surpassing those in Gangnam and Gwacheon districts built around the same period, but also widely known for its breathtaking landscape surrounded by five mountains ？ Buramsan, Suraksan, Sapaesan, Dobongsan and Bukhansan.<br>The title of this exhibition, [25.7], refers to the uniform size of apartments in the New Town districts. Measured in pyeong, a Korean unit for measuring floorspace, the space roughly equals 85 square meters . The uniform size was adopted as part of the Housing Construction Promotion Act, enacted in 1972 under the Park Chung-hee administration, and was declared “the most universal and standard unit of floorspace” fit for the average family of four or five. Even after forty years, the unit is still widely used today in public housing projects and residential complexes. Developed by the government-owned Korea Land and Housing Corporation, Sanggye New Town was also built according to the 25.7 pyeong unit, but incorporated different layouts within the building, which differentiated it from the other new towns.<br>Seoul Focus 2017 [25.7] explores the residential ecosystem of apartment communities in the city by examining its infrastructures such as commercial buildings and school systems in the local districts. The exhibition also looks into the development of diverse hobbies and leisure activities among the residents, revealing the diverse spectrum of life that lies underneath the seemingly standardized urban environment. At same time, [25.7] takes a critical approach to the family-centered lifestyle of the middle class in Korea. From the perspective of the so-called “apartment generation,” the exhibition reconsiders the meaning of apartments as both private and public space which define our cities.<br>The exhibition is presented in two parts. Part 1 examines the historical and local significance of Sanggye New Town and apartment culture through the everyday lives of baby boomers. In contrast, Part 2 traces the echo boomers, a new generation born and raised within the apartment ecosystem. Presenting contemporary artworks from their perspectives, the exhibition hopes to explore the unique significance of apartments specific to Korean culture and art.<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fex%2FEXI01%2F2022%2F&FILE_NM=20220219093833_d4319ffb0eff45b09cdb87899186d57b_552b1b1b509f4143bbf5f8898e4f2f47,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=953183,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The achievements of women graphic designers have received little attention by the male-dominated approaches to historical research, especially in the field of graphic design that generally lacks documentation and discussion.  Another factor in women’s work remaining anonymous is due to the social circumstances wherein which women graphic designers experience difficulties in advancing their careers beyond certain limits within particular social organizations, such as corporations and educational institutions. This exhibition is the beginning of a long-term effort to document and celebrate the activities of women graphic designers that are different from the male-centered historical perspectives and narratives, which are prevalent in the field of Korean graphic design.  The exhibition presents the major accomplishments of ninety one women graphic designers that have each made a mark in the history of Korean graphic design. Their names and achievements include the following: Nami Rhee from Studio BAF who edited and designed the women’s magazine Eve, Heesun Seo who designed the first issue of the lifestyle magazine WAY, Jimi An who runs Alma Books, Dongshin Kim who runs Dongshinsa, Hyunkyung Kim from Hongdesign and Yunjeong Ahn from Designpark, Hyewon Sohn from Crosspoint who branded Chamisul Soju, Woogyung Geel and Heesun Kim who branded the Hyundai Department Store Food Hall, Yeounjoo Park who designed the complete works of William Shakespeare from Moonji Publishing, and Jiwon Yu who designed the complete works of William Shakespeare from Minumsa Publishing. However, this archive is still a rough and incomplete collection of works that has been gathered, as if quickly scanning the stage from front to back. The exhibition did not follow a thorough and objective standard for selecting works, thus many great women graphic designers are not yet included. In other words, this archive should be conceived as a suggestion that is open to debate and renewal, rather than a closed list like the & #39;hall of fame.’ The exhibition guide will be installed inside and outside of the exhibition space, even though the audience has the freedom to choose the order, means, and attitudes to view the archive. Yeounjoo Park suggests the audience’s attitude to exhibition asking to visit the exhibition space. The formless list of graphic designers is materialized into photos and installed in the exhibition space by Texture on Texture. Euddeum Yang installs the extended captions of 85 works and look beyond the work. Eunjoo Hong recovers the tendency presented by rearranging the list. Small Studio Semi shouts out the names of designers. On the one side of the exhibition hall, Woo! School recommends Feminism in the view of reading the archive. We reinterpret the archive to connect the past, present, and future of Korean women graphic designers.

The Art Communication Project of the SeMA is a project aimed at expanding opportunities for enjoyment of art culture by visiting the places where citizens live and close to them. This project will be held in the center of Gangnam-gu with the Gangnam Cultural Foundation after 2015. For us, Gangnam is a complex city with many high-rise buildings. Urban development began in the 1960s in Seoul, with the opening of roads, apartments, and high-rise buildings, the Gangnam area, which was a paddy field, grew rapidly into a city. With the expansion of space and the driving force of urban growth, many people gathered on the narrow and narrow land, and the present Gangnam was born. Unlike the exhibitions on the theme of the city, which has been criticized in the past, & lt;Imagination City, Gangnam& gt;, which is being held this time, is an exhibition to change the life of & #39;I& #39; The exhibition starts from the employees who live near the exhibition center in the middle of Gangnam and are the representative visitors of the exhibition. It is designed to be an opportunity to make the city & #39;Gangnam& #39; more fresh and enjoyable every day to those who come to Gangnam Station in the same city every other day. Through this exhibition, selected works among the collections of SeMA can meet different perspectives of artists and imagination of different cities. In addition, in Gangnam, tourists who visit the city& #39;s everyday exhibitions provide imagination notes to viewers so that they can imagine their own city. & lt;Imaginative City, Gangnam& gt; is an exhibition of artists& #39; work on the everyday city as if they follow a fairy tale or a SF story, and the active imagination of visitors is a chance to create a rich daily story through the city All. We hope to be a continuation of a new and funny day with imagination through art.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_aa54dd32bf99403c836c13ef6104387b_5b329458292540f2bf3b6751dd58108d,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=571,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

This exhibition focuses on the expanded relationship between mapping and space, particularly in the city. Compared with natural spaces or rural areas, which are mostly located outside cities, the city is a contested zone, in and through which new modes of production, socio-political actions and relations are competitively generated, to seize a dominant position in exercising decisive force. In other words, the city can be a proper place to provide more chances to perceive and experience the transformation and conflicts of existing relations and systems in an encounter with new spatial rule and perception. In some countries, particularly South Korea, people tend to use the spaces of the city more actively than those of other countries, not only because over 50% of total population in South Korea are concentrated in the cities, but also because, in many cases, spaces are used simply as an essential means for earning more profits, such as competitive development, investment of residential and commercial places and the occupation and transformation of public spaces. Considering the complex spatiality and spatialization of the cities in South Korea, mapping cannot be understood from a single unitary perspective, as a space is not a fixed entity, but constantly produced and changed in its interrelationship with different forces, movements, relations and perceptions. ‘Mapping the City’ concerns ways in which mapping can act as new form of collecting, producing, coding, decoding, recording, & #40;re& #41;ordering and visualizing existing spatial knowledge and relations in and through the space of art; and how contemporary changes in perceiving and understanding the world alter the meaning and practice of mapping. The exhibition is structured in four different spaces, perspectives and methods of mapping the city. By developing the idea of mapping, these four artworks visualize specific aspects, moments or places, which have been forgotten, overlooked or invisible, covered with dominant powers and systems of urban space in South Korea.  ?

Hong Sungdo pioneered the new changes and expressions during the 1980s to 1990s in the Korean art scene with his works, which deviated from traditional sculpture, providing unique visual experiences through familiar yet disparate materials including plants, neon, and fluorescence. The “Tourist” series donated for this occasion has been underway since 2005, in which Hong crumpled the photos he took during his journey in Italy, Cuba, Japan, and so forth, cut into pieces before attaching onto other photos, or piled up multiple photos to create a sculpture.<br><br>Hong attempted to create a work that presents seemingly similar yet different images by attaching other photos taken at different times onto a two-dimensional picture. Consequently, beholders encounter Hong’s journey with multilayered time (time gap) and scenes (parallax), thereby observing the works and reading into the meanings in between those layers.<br><br>Traveling helps one pay attention to every change and situation occurring around him or her. Leading a busy life, we may pay attention to and try to find the meaning of an object we surely encounter every single day. SeMA hopes that every visitor to our special exhibition “Time Gap and Parallax” ？ consisting of donated works by Hong Sungdo ？explores the “Tourist” series, the embodiment of Hong’s observation, attention, and expression from his journey, and experiences a voyage.<br></p>",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_288b0e3bc5394a84aac039501646d92b_b9928e36d1db4e55a8df054f6f55596c,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=568,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The works in this exhibition examine the social, political and cultural events that have shaped British artistic practice since the 1980s. Rather than focusing on historic narrative, participating artists explore the differences derived from social class and identity, and the negotiation of political and social division, through their individual practices, voices and artworks.   Jeremy Deller and Alan Kane’s Folk Archive contains over 280 artifacts, providing a thought-provoking foundation from which to look into British traditions, cultures and identities. The photographs of Martin Parr and Paul Graham capture traces of conflict and division encoded in everyday life. Grayson Perry’s large-scale tapestry tackles what it might mean to call oneself British today by combining themes common to the lives of communities and individuals, and Mark Wallinger’s video installation gently undermines Britain’s preoccupation with class and hierarchy. Mona Hatoum, Lubaina Himid, John Akomfrah and Samson Kambalu remind us of what it means to exist differently, and their works use personal experience and narrative to critically engage with ideas of identity and belonging. Works by Cally Spooner, Rachel Maclean, Bob and Roberta Smith, Wolfgang Tillmans and Ed Hall, as artists as well as citizens, address some of the urgent issues facing present-day Britain, expressing a range of political positions and finding resonance with earlier work by Gillian Wearing.   Together, the exhibition delves deep into the ‘dissonance’ inherent in any society, where different people come together to voice their individual and shared concerns. The diversity of subject matter explored demonstrates the richness of artistic practice that has emerged in Britain in response to social, cultural and political changes since the 1980s. Weaving together both new and historic artworks, the exhibition celebrates the artist’s voice, suggesting the possibilities to make our own voice heard within society.

The Self-Evolving City explores the East Asian spatial concept based on unity with nature which can be shared between architecture and contemporary art, and the vision of self-evolving future city architecture through the theme of ‘Self-Evolving’, in an attempt to examine sustainable city, space and life.  As a megacity that represents East Asia, Seoul also faces issues related to urbanization which are directly linked to the issues of life. Through this exhibition, we intend to accentuate the fact that modern cities are not simply built as a result of urban planning, but are actually evolving with their own characteristic life force. Furthermore, the exhibition will be an attempt at new interpretations, discovering the self-evolving factors hidden within the traditions of Korean architecture, and thereby actively connecting them to the vision of future self-evolving cities.  The Self-Evolving City exhibition consists of four sections. The first section is downtown Seoul centered on the Fortress Town of Hanyang. When it was developed as a new capital with the foundation of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392, its main facilities were initially planned out according to the Confucian layout concept and sited by geomancy, and from then on changed in space and form through urban evolution. Although it underwent fundamental changes, especially in the process of modernization, the modern architects of Korea have designed buildings in a way that revived the traditional urban context. The second section is Gangnam, Seoul, which was developed in the late 1960s. Since it was built during the development era according to the modern model of a city, Gangnam has emerged as the center of Seoul’s economy, culture and education. In this exhibition, we will be showing the ideology of modern urban planning that appeared in the process of Gangnam’s birth, along with the creation and evolution of new types of architecture that correspond to it such as apartments, offices, and neighborhood facilities. The third section covers the two new towns of Songdo and Sejong, which were newly built around the year 2000. Although these two new towns have exposed many differences in their foundational background and process, we can find attempts to overcome modern models in these cities, and they also show coincidence with important concepts of self-evolution. And the last section of this exhibition will be an exhibition of the winning works for the International Open Idea Competition for the Self-Evolving City of the Future, along with artistic interpretations by artists about future cities and life.  The Self-Evolving City exhibition will reexamine the transformation process of Korean architecture and cities through the two perspectives of planning and evolution, and explore what is necessary to create a future city with the potential for self-evolution. Above all, we hope that through this exhibition, the audiences will be able to gain a richer experience of how art is integrating the city, architecture, and our lives through its unique power of imagination as it attempts to solve the urban issues of today.

This year, we present Tchah Sup Kim, the first generation Korean diaspora artist, along with Sojung Jun, a young generation artist who is interested in investigating our condition of life in the worldwide socio-economic structure of free trade and globalization. Putting the two artist’s works together, this exhibition tries to examine and compare their views on the ‘border identity’ in the context of international migration. Kim believes that we need to read the spirit of the times embedded in artworks based one’s own understanding of his or her time. On the other hand, Jun adopts the methods of ‘diff?rance’ addressing the problems of global market economy simultaneously taking place in the entire world. She shows a playful attitude and cosmopolitanism on the common matters.

From abroad, the period was marked by the conflicting ideologies of the Cold War, from the Vietnam War and anti-war protests, to the U.S. and Soviet space race and the Apollo 11 landing on the moon. It was also a time when the groundbreaking space technology seemed to promise a new beginning for humanity. On the cultural dimension, a spirit of resistance dominated, with the youth subculture alongside the hippie and psychedelic movements coexisting in multiple narratives within the realm of popular culture.  Asian Diva: The Muse and the Monster examines how those political and cultural influences of the West have been woven into the local context of postcolonial cultures in Korea and other countries in Southeast Asia. More specifically, the exhibition focuses on the stigmatized subcultures of the period under the violence and repression of the military order under Yushin indoctrination, as well as the women and minorities of the time who have been marginalized to the fringes of the strictly male-centered patriarchic society. The exhibition introduces the popular culture of Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia from the 1960s and & #39;70s represented by cultural icons such as Kim Chooja and Hahn Dae-soo, examining the postcolonial experiences in the region through the lens of pop culture by exploring a wide range of issues centering on the realities of women, gender and sexuality, and more broadly, the Cold War and political dictatorship.  Presenting works by contemporary artists including Kim Soyoung, Rho Jae Oon, Park Chan Kyong, Arahmaiani, Yoshiko Shimada, siren eun young jung, and Jane Jin Kaisen, together with the geometric abstraction and experimental art of the 1960s and & #39;70s by artists Kim Ku-lim, Park Seo-Bo and Sung Neungkyung, Asian Diva: The Muse and the Monster highlights the spirit of resistance and the zeitgeist captured in the artworks. The exhibition also displays a selection of works by the artist Chun Kyung-ja from her years as a military painter during the Vietnam War, in addition to a wide- ranging archive of cultural memorabilia including a personal collection and recordings of the singer Kim Chooja which are presented to the public for the first time. Through the exhibition, we would like you to hear the female voices that had been deserted, forgotten and unheard that exploring various histories of women in Asia under the dictatorship and patriarchic society.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_21eb6aa82e3d404495abd108ac840e7f_2c673b615b0a4d07a394a325a64f1748,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=546,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

It is also becoming more widely acceptable nowadays to recognize such passion and proficiency. The landscape of the dukhoo universe is also changing, as diversified facets of media production and distribution are allowing more people to express their individuality, while sharing common interests and communicating information with others. Project Dukhoo: Finding Flow observes the temperament, gestures, and behaviors of dukhoo that are uniquely acquired in the process of “finding flow,” the act of engaging their passion in various realms. By highlighting their significance in the context of changing social awareness, the exhibition examines the contemporary sociocultural phenomenon defined by the term, dukhoo.   The eleven artists participating in this group exhibition present a diverse spectrum of works across genre and medium that delve into the cultural phenomenon of dukhoo. Some explore the boundaries between everyday life and art by engaging in hobbies that reveal their artistic attitudes, or by collecting objects that closely reflect their creative inspiration and the trends of pop culture. Others experiment with creating new context by appropriating the languages or production methods specific to their areas of interest such as anime films, while some artists probe the systems of production and consumption, as well as the stereotypes of dukhoo in ways of examining the dynamics of cultural trends. There are also works that invite the viewers to experience the “essence of dukhoo,” and by doing so, challenge the stereotypes that disregard the act of “finding flow” as meaningless.   What the dukhoo phenomenon indicates to our culture today is the values implied in the act of “finding flow,” understanding one’s inner needs and dedicating oneself to achieve it. As both diversity and professionalism are becoming more recognized in our society, such commitment to oneself may inspire more proactive attitudes toward life. By exploring the phenomenon of dukhoo, the exhibition hopes to shed light on one of the most significant subcultures of our time and share the experience of “finding flow” with the viewers.    *& #41; Dukhoo is a shortened form of odukhoo, a term adopted by Korean internet users to pronounce the Japanese word otaku, meaning “a person with obsessive interests.”  ",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_3ab7a491df994f6bbde5c97190b5cc9e_4a1cc1dfb9504e44ac1f695f1981f885,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=527,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The exhibition aims to illuminate unnoticed artworks and areas within SeMA’s collection. As its first attempt, the museum is focusing on its contemporary craft collections.   Crafts is one of the longest surviving forms of art. However, its definition has been constantly challenged by fundamental questions raised by the changing notion of art and the process of industrialization. In the process of discussion, new forms of craftworks based on aesthetic expression rather than functionality, deviating from its expected quality of practical use, have played a significant role.   Rethinking Craft: Between studio craft and contemporary art consists of works from contemporary craft artists who have developed their art practices through formal experiments as well as explorations of materials and techniques. The artists are unique in their engagement with unconstrained art practices based on traditional concepts of craft and artistic expansion across different genres of art.   The exhibition tries to offer multiple angles of view on contemporary craft by presenting together various disciplines of art, including paintings and sculptures that exhibit similar qualities in artistic expression and subject matter to the craftworks from the collection. Additionally, the exhibition includes works that strategically appropriate traditional materials and techniques of craft, thereby giving us an opportunity to re-think the meaning of craft in contemporary art.

Works as references are shown in this opportunity of publishing a pirate edition of a catalogue which has never been disclosed to the public.

Park Sunmin& #40;NANJI 11th& #41; executed a work plan which was aborted in its proposal stage 11 years ago. After the demolition of Namsan Botanical Garden in 2006, the plants are gone and only the documents that record the species remain. The work, recalling the names of things that have been vanished, begins with the sketching of the botanical language.  Choi Haeri& #40;NANJI 11th& #41; presents a sequel, or a parallel exhibition to Art Spectrum 2016, a past exhibition which converts classics and hybridizes the past and present. She makes another variation in the sensation of experiencing the original, by partly appropriating the original exhibition which juxtaposes the original and copy.  The pirate edition sometimes becomes illegal involuntarily. This happens when legal distribution becomes limited, or in the process of acquiring things that are condemned as lacking marketable value in terms of supply and demand. Pirate Edition is an exhibition which reclaims the original form of works that were at one point on the verge of disappearance or were unwillingly mutated due to the cancellation of the project or other unforseen restrictions.

At the time of its founding in 2006, it was a project which provided artists with studio spaces in line with the City of Seoul’s policy to invigorate unused spaces in the city. In the 10 years of the program, SNR has developed a step further, transforming into an artist residency program. Having produced over 300 artists and researchers from residency, this archive exhibition endeavors to reflect on the memories and process of the program up to present.  The exhibition is divided into three sections. First, a timeline of SNR reflects on the past, pivoting on events that laid the foundation of the residency program. The second section ‘Program at NANJI’ presents major activities that demonstrate the identity of SNR as a residency program, under the categories Research/Exhibition/Exchange. The empty spaces that have not been archived in the official history will be filled slowly with the memories of individual artists through video and survey in the following section.  This exhibition was produced with the cooperation of former residency artists at SNR. In addition to the survey, the moments from the past were recollected in the exhibition, thanks to artists and their works, including the transformation of an old signpost of Nanji into an art work, and reinvention of an old Lakulaku folding bed that’s been in actual use for the last 10 years into a display table.  While the exhibition wraps up the first 10 years of SNR and its process of establishing its foundation as a residency program, this exhibition also presents an opportune moment to take a breath and imagine the next 10 years to come. Hopefully, the questions produced in the history of the institution propel the audience to expand their minds in imagining the new possibilities for SNR.

The present exhibition is based on an analogy between the disappearing social communities in modern life with the words and acts of greetings that is also disappearing in contemporary societies.   Seeing a stranger and saying Hello to them enables people to recognize the unknown other and start to explore the possibility of approaching the inner world of each other. When the practice of greeting becomes a habit and a routine, it also becomes institutionalized as a means or a social convention that makes possible the caring and concerning for the members of community.  The nine artists participating in the current exhibition are outsiders: but they act as ‘catalysts’ in that they deeply infiltrate into the regional community and invite others to engage in the community members’ life. The artists’ engagement, moreover, requires the members to participate in the process of their art making. The ambivalent feelings of awkwardness and intimacy aroused between insiders and strangers are familiar to everyone. We know the feelings from our repeated experience of meeting and relating with other people.   During the past six months, nine artists built up relationship with residents and the history of five districts in northeast region of Seoul. The artists’ work helped the members of the communities recognize their own existence and each other’s and restore the sensus communis & #40;in Kantian philosophy& #41; which is urgently required in the age of virtual relationship and dispersed online communities.

This exhibition was designed as the artists discussed how to put their works together within the unique exhibition space of SeMA Storage & #40;an annex of SeMA& #41;.   NANJI 10th artists and researchers reunited at SeMA Storage on a weekday afternoon on February 8th, 2017 & #40;a month after they moved out from their studios& #41;. Leaving behind the delight of seeing each other for a moment, while discussing their ideas, the artists thoroughly checked out the space to decide which works to exhibit and how to display them.  The artists got to better understand each other’s work during their yearlong stay at SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY because through & lt;NANJI ART SHOW& gt; series, they were able to work with each other many times in the past. & lt; NANJI ART SHOW & gt; is a program that the artists hold continuous meetings and sharing ideas about each others’ work at the beginning of their stay at the residency and realize a group exhibition. Because of this experience, the artists were able to progress smoothly in selecting and displaying their works even though the task could have been quite a difficult process. Meanwhile, we asked them for deions of their works which are required in the gallery for its audience to help their better understand and for its catalogue. The writings sented by NANJI 10th artists were very well articulated, so we only had to go through minor revisions and proofreading.  As the research program of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY, there are & lt;Art Critique Workshop& gt; which continued on from before and & lt;Abstract Workshop& gt; was held for the first time last year with the 10th Nanji residents. & lt;Abstract Workshop& gt; is the educational program, where artists were able to practice in communicating the ideas behind their works. Guided by an art critic, the artists learned about the definitions, necessities and methodologies of annotation. Then, they wrote about their own practices, discussing and revising afterwards. We believe that this process has much improved the artists’ writing skills. So, it is with no exaggeration to say that the selection of works and their interpretations for this exhibition were solely produced by NANJI 10th artists and researchers. I would also like to add that the artists took the lead in the curation of the exhibition, fully utilizing the unique architectural space of SeMA Storage.   Repurposing the reagent warehouse building of the pharmaceutical testing laboratory of the former Center for Disease Control and Prevention established in the 1960s, SeMA Storage is an alternative art space run by SeMA. This unique space maintains the architectural framework that was previously used & #40;such as the wooden shelves and structures& #41;, revealing traces of time. The artists select works that are suited for the rough features of the space. We can see the similarities and connections between the experimental and inquisitive tendencies of their art practices and the nature of the space & #40;a site that previously stored chemicals& #41;.   SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY 10th Review & lt;Report &Recall& gt; has Korean title & lt;bogo-sib-da& gt;, which is a form of wordplay. The term, ’sib’ means ‘ten’, referring to NANJI 10th, and the term, ‘bogo’ possesses multiple meanings such as ‘reporting & #40;報告& #41;’,’ the artists’ treasure ‘troves & #40;寶庫& #41;’, and ‘a trove & #40;寶庫& #41;’ & #40;as a precious storage of works& #41;. In other words, we can interpret this as “an exhibition where one desires to look again and again at the various works and research achievements of NANJI 10th artists and researchers.”  We hope this exhibition attracts people to return and see the works again and again, recalling the artworks and the artists’ experimental spirit which is presented inside this space that captures the atmosphere of the past.& #40;PARK Soon-young& #41; ",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_cfdad68e3b8c44358a540492f74536c1_71310d8761974a2cac563806ce9ab0f3,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=528,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

SeMA is pleased to invite the pioneer of Hangul typography Ahn Sang-soo and Paju Typography Institute for SeMA Green 2017. nalgae.pati, the title of this exhibition indicates a collaboration of two entity, Ahn Sang-soo and Paju Typography Institute. nalgae & #40;wings& #41; is the pen name of designer Ahn Sang-soo who’s also the director of Paju Typography Institute, and pati is an abbreviation for Paju Typography Institute. On nalgae section, the exhibition explores the series of letter paintings of Ahn from the early period starting from Ahn Sang-soo font to recent works including hollyula & #40;being immersed& #41; canvas painting seires. Most of his previous works are digitized to offer us to experience abstract sensation and visual appreciation of Hangul letters, distanced from their social meaning and conventional uses. They are rather closer to pictographic or hieroglyphic arrangement of Hangul alphabets by recomposing our perception on the conventional understanding on the language, Hangul. The original sources were created throughout Ahn’s lifetime career as a graphic designer and visual communicator who has continually seek for his own language as a creator in this specific region of South Korea. His experiment consists destructing, rearranging and restyling of Korean alphabets in varied forms including letter typing, drawing, rubbing, calligraphy, painting and performance. His love and respect upon Hangul has expanded to the core spirit of Paju Typography Institute for finding the most of our own education rooted on ‘doing design’ and ‘designing life’.  Paju Typography Institute was established in Paju Book City in 2013 as a design community and also as an education cooperative. On pati section, there is the archive of last 5 years of the school. Starting from the establishment of institute, there is the photographic and text materials of varied events including construction of yisangjib & #40;undergraduate building& #41;, freshman orientation, welcoming ceremony and visiting Yeongneung & #40;tomb of King Sejong, the Hangul creator& #41; to series of curriculums and projects that every participants of PaTI has ‘designed’ and worked together for last five years. The archive is not only for offering basic information of the school, but also for sharing multi-layered philosophy of them as a whole and on-going experiment which aims at finding our own educational language. The series of workshops designed by PaTI teachers are also prepared to invite the potential community of the museum in order to experience PaTI and PaTI’s idea in depth. This is for performing the archive in the exhibition space and for expanding their pedagogical idea into social structure. Besides them, series of small programs designed by students of PaTI is also invited for revealing issues and topics of young generation which offer us at the same time to think about future designers and about designing life in different forms in contemporary society.

519,356,From SeMA Collection : City and the People,,"Buk-Seoul Museum of Art, 2F",2017-01-17,2017-03-26,,,,Tue-Fri 10am-8pm,Admission is Free ,,,,,"From SeMA Collection: City and the People   City and the people is an exhibition examining the distinctive aspects of the people living here and now, and the social backgrounds they are based on. Focusing on our society’s collective experiences, such as “estranged labor” and increasing “social instability” which in turn create “excluded and marginalized existences,” the works in this exhibition demonstrate critical awareness of the social situation. Selected primarily from SeMA’s permanent collection, the artworks have been interwoven together based on the socio-cultural codes we presently share instead of being categorized by time period, genre, and form. From these social codes that are familiar to us through film and literature, the viewers will be able to access the multilayered textures and substances of the works.  The exhibition is organized into three sections. The first section examines the marginal beings on the boundaries of society that lead meaningless lives only to gratify their desires. Standing at the edge of globalized neoliberalism where anything can be done for the sake of profit, we voluntarily lend ourselves to slavery of capitalism for our own consumption & #40;Eternal Slaves& #41; and pursue our private desires over social introspection or critical awareness & #40;Bodies Laden with Desire& #41;. These collective experiences are reflected into codes of repetitive labor and selfish attitudes that have been vividly portrayed in a wide array of films and television dramas. The works included in this section visualize these issues by making a parody of meaningless repetitive actions, or revealing the invisible structures of consumer capitalism and those who are dominated by the objects of desire. In addition, this section of the exhibition also juxtaposes works that investigate the boundary objects that are structuralized as much as the humans under social conditions.  The second section of the exhibition explores marginal groups as sites where social instability and desire are unveiled. Minorities & #40;Invisible People& #41;, who were often excluded and hidden from history, have been suppressed by the authority and the mainstream in order to consolidate the system. Nevertheless, minorities have never been forgotten and are constantly revived in our memories. Young people & #40;Convenience Store Human& #41;, with their livelihood showing no signs of improvement despite the struggles, project themselves onto the excluded characters in webtoons and novels, taking them on as their alter ego, while reconstructing the narrative as a way of breaking the ties. These works delve into moments when the familiar turns into the unfamiliar and react to their conditions by raising questions on social perceptions and standards.   Lastly, the works on display at the Project Gallery2 focus more on hopeful destruction. These works assert that we must acknowledge and overcome our own foolishness in order to break away from this state where we cannot be ourselves, that we should not label and restrict the underprivileged, and that it is essential for us to recover our sense of humanity.   The economic crisis, various calamities & #40;such as nuclear disasters, earthquakes, and the nationwide spread of MERS& #41;, and terror incidents are increasingly becoming a part of our everyday anxieties and horrors. It may also be true that the Korean society has been trapped in stagnation and guilt for quite some time but it is clear that even in the present moment, the Korean people continue to search for hope by joining forces together. The works in this exhibition are those that have tried to catch these signs early on and interpret them. The exhibition and the artworks hope to provide an opportunity to recover our lost sense of direction and find ways to move forward.

Buk-Seoul Museum of Art’s Children’s Gallery organizes exhibitions that combine viewing and experiences in order to familiarize children and families to contemporary art, making it more accessible.   The point & #40;which is the beginning of a shape& #41;, a line & #40;which has a direction& #41;, and a plane & #40;which creates area and space& #41; are the basic elements of art. These elements are needed in order for humans to perceive objects and spaces around them and to express feelings and thoughts in a formal language. Understanding the point, line, and plane is an important step in the pedagogy of children and their aesthetic experience. Based on this understanding Point·Line·Plane invites the artist Hong Seung-Hye, who has long carried out experiments ―both in content and form― with spaces constructed by the pixel ― the smallest unit of the digital image. Hong’s Organic Geometry series, which imbues natural qualities such as irregularity and contingency to the cold geometric elements of point, line, and plane, began as abstract images on computer screens and has expanded to different forms such as real objects & #40;like furniture& #41;, videos, and music. Based on the artist’s own practice, this exhibition aims to provide children a new experience of point, line, and plane.  Consisting of new works that reflect various qualities of point, line, and plane, the exhibition is divided into two categories. First, there is a pedagogical mural and videos that show the process in which points expand to lines and planes. Partitioning the space anew, painted square frames that are placed in different areas in the exhibition space look like independent planes separated from the existing architecture. Additionally, the creation and variation of point, line, and plane are demonstrated through a work of wall stickers that depict constellations, circles, and squares. Also, a flash animation that shows moving geometric figures that looks like dancing through sound created by the artist.     In another vein, there are installations that construct daily objects from geometric figures. Objects that are easily recognizable by anyone such as a jungle gym, stools, tables, and pushmobiles, encourage the audience’s bodily engagement while imparting familiarity and abstraction. In the process of touching and moving objects that are reduced to geometric shapes yet still closely related to our lives, viewers might be able to think again about familiar and seemingly natural forms and spaces.   This exhibition is organized to help children easily learn the concept of point, line, and plane. Moreover, beyond a simple visual appreciation of artworks it allows the audience to play and communicate with each other. Through this process we expect the audience to experience the infinite possibilities of point, line, and plane, and see anew the objects and spaces found in the everyday environment.

107,103,Mirror Image : About a Self Portrait,,SeMA Namseoul Annex Building,2008-08-13,2008-10-05,,,,,,,,,,"&lt;Mirror Image : About a Self-Portrait&gt; is an exhibition looking into a variety of aspects and meaning of self-portrait that has been changed with the conventional way of photography using a mirror and the development of media. 'Mirror' as a motive makes it to analogize a new world with imitating the original and to look back not only to the exterior but interior. It illuminates the relationship and meaning between the artist, his/her self, and their works expressing the self. When we reflect an existence and aspect, we often call it a 'mirror image.' This is because within the ambivalence of the mirrored image including the reflection as what it is and that of the right side to the left, the self-reflection and agony can be driven.According to Jacques Lacan, mirror is an object that makes it possible to realize self as a subject. There was a moment that human was called 'Homo Speculum,' and the word 'Speculum,' meaning 'mirror' in Latin, is the origin of 'speculation.' Likewise the existence of mirror, reflecting an image itself and its inner side, are applied as the important motives that show the artist's inner sight through the subject, self-portrait. Self-portrait, a genre of portrait, is created by a painter with regarding 'self' as an object for representation. Since 'portray' is originated from the Latin word 'protrahere,' meaning 'to discover' and 'to draw,' self-portrait is beyond drawing a self image; it is to discover another self and to draw the inner self. Thus, we can read manifold inner thoughts through the self-portrait such as the artist's mental state, self-affection, self-display, self-identification, and self-pity. For artists representing their own views of looking at the world through their works, the thought and agony about self can surely be a significant proposition. The inner nature and anguish about identity are the subjects of speculation as the most fundamental proposition for a work of art. Self-portrait, one of those to reflect it in the most direct way, has been constantly studied with a variety of subjects and methods in the East and West. The acknowledgement of panting self-image began from the Renaissance when the concept of artist and signature on works of art started. The conventional self-portrait was the drawing of the reflected self-image on a mirror, and after the development of photography, there became a new type of describing it by capturing a moment. Nowadays, due to the advent of digital camera, self has had a role as an available object by self-capturing methods, and it is possible to capture and express a different dimension of self-mage from the one captured by others or by using a tripod. Moreover, the methods of synthesizing self with another self-image, or disguising it have been reached by the development of different media in order to create a new self, and some artists often apply a completely different object into their self-image to symbolize their psychological states. The main feature of this exhibition is to look into the aspects of self-portrait created by Korean artists after the modern age and their inner meanings. It consists of two sections ;&lt;Microcosmos in a face&gt;, a collection of works of self-portrait as a mirror image reflecting a face as it is, &lt;Inner mirror, a mask image&gt;, showing the distorted and refracted characteristics of mirror as a 'mask image.' This exhibition has an attempt to look through the works of modern to contemporary artists and to look deeply into what 'self' is for artists, what inspiration they could give and from what inspiration they could create their self-portraits, and how it is expressed and understood inside their works. Thus, it is aimed to offer the opportunity to ask again the meaning of the 'artist him/herself' as a subject matter, to consider the diverse changing aspects of expressing identity, and to speculate on the images of contemporary artists and ourselves.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_cd950d77b1f741e38272d4950e66539a_f3314102443d47aebbd887248c60614e,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=107,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

SeMA Gold is part of the special biennial exhibition series; SeMA Green, for senior artists; SeMA Gold, for mid-career artists; and SeMA Blue, for emerging artists. Geared towards mid-career artists who have already established their own artistic practices and are at the forefront of the Korean art scene, SeMA Gold invites artists to participate and respond to its given themes. Different from its previous incarnations, this year SeMA Gold focuses on the 1990s, a turning point in Korean art, and attempts to reflect on the significance of contemporary Korean art in aesthetics and cultural history.  Symptoms that signify milestones in the 1990s ― the 90s’ zeitgeist that differentiates itself from the 70s and the 80s, are sensed in the post-ideological practices of Generation X who represented this era. To be more specific, we can see small groups of movements and projects that re-codified the various cultural signifiers of the time such as art, technology, mass media and subcultures into an emancipated underground language.  The 1990s have already become a new cultural keyword through a recent TV soap opera & #39;Reply& #39; series gaining lots of popularity. Summoning the 1990s in the name of contemporary art, this exhibition focuses on the paradigm shifts of contemporary art ― Postmodernism and Globalism―, and focuses on its influence on today& #39;s art and dynamic relations. This will become an opportunity to illuminate the art historical achievements of the leading artists from Generation X who, as enfant-terribles shifted the ground of the Korean art world in the 1990s.  X: Korean Art in the 1990s constructs the exhibition’s narrative by reconstructing works from that era and amassing various archives. In regards to the concern that this retrospective exhibition might become a simple historicization or sentimentalist nostalgia, the exhibition re-contextualizes art of the 90s within the specificity of its time and place, focusing on visualizing its continuity with the present. I would like to thank all the participating artists who have shown us regard and have given us such tremendous support by presenting works and lending materials.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_a24d9586e52940108ca0db006a57d940_0ca3a209706244be8d6143650d8ac632,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=514,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
517,351,Today's onggi: Hyun Bae Lee,,SeMA Living Arts Museum ,2016-12-13,2017-02-26,,,,Tue~Fri 10:00~20:00  / Weekends and Holidays: 10:00-18:00,,Onggi,600,,,"To close the year 2016, SeMA Nam-Seoul Living Arts Museum presents & lt;TODAY’S ONGGI: HYUN-BAE LEE& gt;.   Master Hyun Bae Lee accepted the difficult challenges of modernizing Onggi believing that it can be adapted to modern life style. He has devoted the past 26 years to creating aesthetically and functionally outstanding Onggi whilst using the traditional creation process. To him, ‘Today’s Onggi’ signify the cycle where all things are born from the earth and eventually return to their origin, as Onggi will return as a traditional household item.   This exhibition is significant because it fully explores the complete works of Master Lee so far, and his oeuvre can be separated into three categories.   First of all, Onggi possess beautiful forms. Onggi’s aesthetic value has been underestimated due to its humble nature in comparison to porcelain. Yet Master Lee has firmly made aesthetical approaches toward traditional Onggi. The shoulder of his Dok & #40;Hang-ari& #41; is wider than the normal Southern style, and the ‘Jeon’ & #40;lips& #41; are firmly constructed so that less deformation is caused during the drying or baking process, resulting in a better form with dynamic features. The texture of the rough soil, the subtle red hidden in the chocolate color induced by burning firewood, and the naturally flowing simple lines, together constitute an exceptionally immaculate beauty.  Furthermore, Master Lee reinterprets the existing shape of Onggi. He has employed the beauty of the modern cylindrical shape of Gonjaengyi Jeot Dok into beautiful a rice container and tall vase which create a harmonious contemporary residential environment.  Additionally, his lotus bud shaped Danji, which resembles Jangdok that are buried underground during the winter season, and Jara bottles that have been transformed into a stylish interior object for decoration are great examples of the mater’s endeavor to bring out the natural beauty of Onggi’s shape.   Second, Onggi plays various roles in contemporary food culture. Master Lee believes that traditional Onggi is essential in achieving the authentic flavor of Korea’s fermented food. Any modern Onggi produced by mechanical processes cannot replicate the flavor ― in terms of fermenting, ripening and preserving freshness ? of traditionally made Onggi. Master Lee has suggested that an average household needed 7 Jangdok in the 90s and now proposes 5-7 Jangdok for smaller households to preserve fermented pastes and seasonings. In this exhibition, his various tableware and cookware are displayed in the form of table settings for a single person. These tables aim to explore today’s food culture such as a simple noodle dish, western table settings, the espresso cup ‘Umji’ with a coffee roaster, ‘Yakson’ which is designed to easily warm a pack of oriental herbal medicine, and the ‘Y?ol Green Set’ that reduces the shrill sound created when cutlery touches the surface of rough Onggi.  Finally, Master Lee has been making Onggi faithful to its own nature. He says that in order to make a true ‘breathing Onggi’, one must be able to build a solid body using soft soil, coat its skin with the natural glaze, and bake thoroughly inside a wood fired kiln.  Lee’s ability to shape, build and fire the pottery in a traditional kiln is based on the deep understanding of the shapes and materiality of Onggi, and this knowledge has been applied to restore the ancient technology for producing large jar coffins found in the area of Naju National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage.  Meanwhile, ‘breathing’ does not only refer to ‘air-permeability’. The master has faith that Onggi finally become themselves when they are used in our daily lives, living and breathing with us. Like the zinc ashtray translated Square Onggi, he wants Onggi to breath in our kitchen, storage and porches.   In the end, it will be more meaningful if the audience can discover the intersection of tradition and modern life, art and life by imagining how and in which form the exhibited Onggi can be utilized in each of our living spaces.

The exhibition, along with the collection, plays a significant role in establishing the museum’s identity and demonstrating its direction. This exhibition explores the dynamics of the institution and its exhibitions which is as much about the shifts in the concept and form of exhibitions as it is about the changes in the museum’s policy and role during different phases.   A select use of resources from past exhibitions is the pivot on which this exhibition turns as it demonstrates the transitions of SeMA according to the demands of each period. The exhibition categorized by period and exhibition-type suggests as a whole a grand or metanarrative of the museum. Yoon Jeewon and Sasa [44] and The Third Readers, a temporary group for this project ? Kim Hak-Lyang, Joungmin Yi, Seewon Hyun ? intervene in the museum’s narrative by supplementing the ‘missing or excluded parts’ as well as reinterpreting it in different ways. Such design is an attempt to view the history of SeMA from diverse dimensions.   When audiences choose to take the initiative, the history of the museum can be read, written, and spoken in various ways instead of being fixed into a closed narrative.

Artists can express the particularities of objects somewhat differently - nonexistence may be felt and the invisible may be seen.

While artists always try to express something and share it, the audience asks questions to its ambiguous expressions. In this exhibition, by presenting their visualization process, their inner emotions and conceptual thoughts we intend to present an artist’s attitude toward thought and the new perspectives generated through the artists’ eyes.

Through the chronicling of past and present a stage for memories comes to coexist inside the present. The artist communicates how the past can be channeled into the present. From an old, secret sump underground a soundtrack is recorded. Not unlike how an old sound is preserved somewhere in the building and re-played through a wall, the work integrates the sounds of the whole space that are transformed as they move through the building’s structure. Bona Park is interested in how social structures - including the art system - operate and how people work to create individuality behind these structures. The artwork for this exhibition involves cropped photographs of hands from pictures of performances since 2011. By cropping around the hands of the performers these documentary photographs implicitly present information like race, sex, labor intensity, and profession. By including a photograph of hands that have constructed the photographic frames the artist gives a nod to those whose work makes an exhibition possible. By revealing the work of those who are usually invisible, the artwork intends to make subtle break in the structure. I believe this suits this exhibition’s subject, visualization of the Invisibles. PARK Yoon Kyung employs a process of imaging texts and making painting installations. She presents a picture of an abstract image that possesses a different front and back. The artist says: “The process in which a text is transformed into image relates to the area that is destroyed when meaning is delivered through the frame of language.” The abstract image is read differently according to an audience’s subjectivity. The first image transmitted by the artist presents this form of meaning’s destruction. In this manner, the abstract is a ground that can accept ‘disputes,’ eliminating the hierarchy between artworks and audiences created by forms of unilateral communication. Furthermore the abstract facilitates an artistic space where artwork, audience and space are given equivalent authority. The actual space projected through the translucent screen and through the installation suggests a picture that enables open forms of interpretation by interacting with the audience, making relations with the audience. Hyungsub Shin expresses objects in a totally new form by using industrial materials and objects from daily life. What is remarkable is the artist’s perspective and mode of visual expression where he represents the form of a natural root using artificial wire or presents unbreakable objects as crushed fragments. ‘Energy Field’ is a mutable installation made from magnets and the objects that are attracted to them. In the areas that are magnetized the objects create a certain form, but they are also easily deformed by other physical forces. The objects are spread on the ground to induce audience participation. From the perspective of the artist and while considering his expressive mode, the audience might sense the artist’s eyes when interpreting the object’s properties. Hyunjeong Lim has interests in expressing the fairytale-like primitive world of the unconscious as a visual image. Lim does so by capturing internal scenes of an imagination and by arousing various feelings inside the viewers. The scenes in her work rearrange private imageries that are only visible to the artist, raising questions about the truth of the invisible. Through her works the artist asks if creating invisible links inside other people’s minds can become a way to understand others who live through different backgrounds and cultures. Heo Suyoung repeatedly overlaps images, maximizing a form of visual multiplicity. When appreciating the artwork, one feels movement as if we could hear inaudible sounds. Multiple visible objects fill the scene, not allowing any empty space. Not knowing when to finish, the work tries to capture every visible thing. The artist continuously draws something in-between and on the drawn objects, as if penetrating, until she can no longer intervene. At last, there is nothing more she can do and she finishes the drawing, but after a while, she says she can still find empty spaces. Seunghee Hong presents the depth of emotions using invisible creases. She forcefully destroys the hard unique properties of matter around an object, creating an intended gravity, and crease made by the sunken object that shows the depth of her emotion. Her work in this exhibition, ‘Force to Depth-same desk presents three desks that are deformed from their original sizes. Presenting the transformed shapes of the desks, the artist expresses the relations of space and time where the desks are positioned.

Instead of taking the title ‘curator’ for granted, the exhibition attempts to unfold the many layers of thoughts that are set into motion when a curator works. The purpose of this exhibition is the sharing of empirical narratives, not the suggestion of theoretical definitions or the normative roles of curating. In order to achieve this, writings from active curators are collected in the form of a self-publication. This publication is produced in an ‘open binder’ format which allows new pages to be continuously added. Named ‘Adding Pages,’ the concept accumulates independent narratives from curators of the same period and proposes another intention for the project. Otherwise, the curators bind the narratives about ‘being curator’ in order to correspond the question constantly asked while working as curator: “Why there is no ‘story’ about this job?” Since the 2000s, curators have cultivated a number of institutional strategies, and & #40;as many professions of Korean society do& #41; despite a structural instability their roles have been romanticized and abstracted. In other words a universal awareness about curators in Korean society exists & #40;its professional image& #41;, but its ‘discourse’ does not. After all, curators of today have too many different qualities and working conditions & #40;depending on their institution& #41; to merely place into a single role, and furthermore in the real world they have broad identities and play various roles from exhibition planners, mediators, administrators, translators, critics, and at times, counselors. Not unlike how it is not extraordinary these days that an artist himself also works as a planner, a planner’s role also becomes interchangeable according to the shifts in contemporary art, becoming more complicated in its definition of titles and character. Based on these issues, the project intends to form a ground where curators with different positionalities and directions can share their stories about their profession and works ? subjects that until now have remained rather invisible. I hope this meeting motivates curators to share some time and ideas about their jobs with other colleagues who might be struggling and building their own context somewhere else.& #40;Eunbi Jo& #41; ",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192849_521d910425a0476aadd4f8a6f1dcea75_e0cf279b9fb84b7e9dd383f2519e68e9,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=504,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Starting from the research that leads to the exhibition’s curation and an open platform for discussion, the exhibition attempts to share the inquiries of this journey.     From Seoul, a Mega-city  Returning to Seoul from the ‘Northeast Asian Mega-cities’ research, in January of 2016 I joined the SeMA Nanji Residency. It was a period when I reflected on how to approach the question of the urbanism and Seoul by looking through all of the research. First of all, I wasn’t comfortable with the prescribed concept of Seoul as a Mega-city. Seoul is said to be a globalized mega-city that ranks as fifth in the world. However, what kind of mega-city do we live in? I thought that it was a painfully familiar place, but I felt it somewhat abstract when trying to imagine the volume of this massive city. To know this city more in depth, I changed my routines. I looked around unfamiliar neighborhoods by walking down the streets in the relatively short distances, and rather than take the subway I used a shuttle & #40;town& #41; bus to get around. The more I experienced the city in this way, the more the spaces of life in the corners of the streets accumulated in my memory. As I experienced the city in this new way, spaces that were relatively hard to approach, banned or could not be used, or places that were disinteresting or neglected came across my mind. As one more deeply inquires into the city, the massive volume of a so-called mega-city disappears. Within a city, numerous undefinable, unnameable spaces exist. In these micro-spaces the activities of different lives of numerous individuals and communities take place. When the form of mega-city disappears, another scenery appears:“there are numerous ‘micro-cities’ in a ‘mega-city’.”   Looking for numerous ‘micro-cities’ within us  The journey that tries to approach the site-specificity of Seoul becomes a motivation in the curation of the exhibition, Micro City Lab. This project of intervening in the city will be held between October 7-31, 2016. The exhibition prompts many discussions on site-specificity through ‘micro-interventions,’ in which 18 teams of artists, architects, collectives, and choreographers from 11 countries intervene in urban spaces on the micro level. During the exhibition period the participating artists’ intervention projects take place in various open spaces of Seoul such as public spaces, in front of department stores, parks, along the streets, vacant lots and unused spaces, in guerilla, irregular, or continuous ways.  The artists’ ‘micro interventions’ will be a beginning to approach the various social relations that are involved within the space of the city. Discussions on concerns of consumerization, authorization, and capitalization of the city, the ongoing violence in the development process of the city, the self-regenerative capabilities of city spaces, and an ethical consciousness of art that intervenes in these processes, will continuously take place in the form of talks, workshops, and tours through the intervening projects’ site-specificity. Pre-Micro City Lab is a platform to open up discussions and methods of approach regarding the ‘site-specificity.’ This forum takes place prior to the main project that will be held in October. In this manner, Pre-Micro City Lab presents curators’ research materials, products from exhibition processes, and archives of the participating artists.

How can a curator’s research and related activities relate to an exhibition? In the series of steps to organize it the process of research in curating an exhibition fully permeates its structure. Sufficient research can formulate deeper discussions and involve more details on the exhibition’s process, on topics such as theme, development, approaches to artworks, and communication with the audience. The exhibition, 'Pre-Micro City Lab', is a kind of preface, an exhibition that presents research. Starting from the research that leads to the exhibition’s curation and an open platform for discussion, the exhibition attempts to share the inquiries of this journey.     From Seoul, a Mega-city  Returning to Seoul from the ‘Northeast Asian Mega-cities’ research, in January of 2016 I joined the SeMA Nanji Residency. It was a period when I reflected on how to approach the question of the urbanism and Seoul by looking through all of the research. First of all, I wasn’t comfortable with the prescribed concept of Seoul as a Mega-city. Seoul is said to be a globalized mega-city that ranks as fifth in the world. However, what kind of mega-city do we live in? I thought that it was a painfully familiar place, but I felt it somewhat abstract when trying to imagine the volume of this massive city. To know this city more in depth, I changed my routines. I looked around unfamiliar neighborhoods by walking down the streets in the relatively short distances, and rather than take the subway I used a shuttle (town) bus to get around. The more I experienced the city in this way, the more the spaces of life in the corners of the streets accumulated in my memory. As I experienced the city in this new way, spaces that were relatively hard to approach, banned or could not be used, or places that were disinteresting or neglected came across my mind. As one more deeply inquires into the city, the massive volume of a so-called mega-city disappears. Within a city, numerous undefinable, unnameable spaces exist. In these micro-spaces the activities of different lives of numerous individuals and communities take place. When the form of mega-city disappears, another scenery appears:“there are numerous ‘micro-cities’ in a ‘mega-city’.”   Looking for numerous ‘micro-cities’ within us  The journey that tries to approach the site-specificity of Seoul becomes a motivation in the curation of the exhibition, 'Micro City Lab'. This project of intervening in the city will be held between October 7-31, 2016. The exhibition prompts many discussions on site-specificity through ‘micro-interventions,’ in which 18 teams of artists, architects, collectives, and choreographers from 11 countries intervene in urban spaces on the micro level. During the exhibition period the participating artists’ intervention projects take place in various open spaces of Seoul such as public spaces, in front of department stores, parks, along the streets, vacant lots and unused spaces, in guerilla, irregular, or continuous ways.  The artists’ ‘micro interventions’ will be a beginning to approach the various social relations that are involved within the space of the city. Discussions on concerns of consumerization, authorization, and capitalization of the city, the ongoing violence in the development process of the city, the self-regenerative capabilities of city spaces, and an ethical consciousness of art that intervenes in these processes, will continuously take place in the form of talks, workshops, and tours through the intervening projects’ site-specificity. 'Pre-Micro City Lab' is a platform to open up discussions and methods of approach regarding the ‘site-specificity.’ This forum takes place prior to the main project that will be held in October. In this manner, <Pre-Micro City Lab> presents curators’ research materials, products from exhibition processes, and archives of the participating artists. Before the interventions in the city begin in October, I hope this exhibition can be a starting point for sharing contexts and inquiries surrounding site-specificity.  <br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>Opening Reception : 2016. 9. 1. 5pm",,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835236,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

496,336,Exhibition of Donated Artworks <Photographs by Kang Bong-kyu : Human Theater>,,Buk Seoul Museum of Art Project Gallery 1-2 ,2016-08-25,2016-12-18,,,,,,,,,,"Exhibition of Donated Artworks& lt;Photographs by Kang Bong-kyu : Human Theater& gt;  presents the works of Kang Bong-Kyu who has been documenting the scenes from historical, political events, lives of the people of the time or traditional feasts including rituals and exorcism. Instead of adopting an ethnographic approach or the history of photography, the exhibition reflects on these lively portraits of human as human documentary speaking to the needs of the time, inviting us to rethink the stance of the photographer as that of a producer or editor.  In Kang& #39;s photographs that share the course of modern history of Korea, you can read the relationship of the society and the photographer, as Bourdieu& #39;s Habitus. The dramatic modernization, industrialization and globalization in the Korean society since the 1960s led the diversion of individuals and the society. While traditional spiritual culture was disappearing, increased mass media kept relaying on fragmented images. There, along the flow of the time, Kang delivered records of the time, traditional lives and the frank face of Koreans through the medias including newspaper, magazine and publications. Kang& #39;s such human documentary pictures the public sphere through the records of individual lives. Conveying personal and public messages in the images, they influenced the formation of social culture. Also, as a photographer that communicated with the public and led the discourse by editing and publishing his own works, Kang& #39;s attitude as a photographer is significant, especially from the perspectives of the present time that all phenomena are delivered, understood and remembered through media or signs.  Thus, the exhibition was organized in three sections. To start with, 1. Picturing the Common Human Theater is placed in Project Gallery 1. Works from newspapers, magazines and publications since the 1960s are presented under categories & #39;Live Documentation of the Contemporary & #39; & #39;Stories of Our People& #39; and & #39;Regional Style and Spirit.& #39; Vivid records of the scene from April Revolution, people& #39;s story in the faces of Koreans with the deep furrows of time and the last moments of the tradition kept by Namwon Dotongri people who later moved to Chenghak-dong. Capturing crucial moments of ordinary people, works invite audiences to actively and deeply engage with the story of these human documentaries intervened by the interaction with the subject. Also, details that unknowingly show up make a profound impression like Roland Barthes& #39; punctum, while tradition that has been disappearing stirs up nostalgia.  2. Delivering the Origin of the Images: Generational Memories in Project Gallery 2 presents works that display the sprit of Korea. From local rituals of Jeollanam-do such as street rituals or exorcism to lyrical landscapes of Korea, the works contain the image of home that a generation shared and the original image of & #39;typical Korea& #39; is being conveyed to the next generation through various media.  Lastly in 3. Photographer as the Producer and Editor, visitors can see an archive of magazines and pictorials he published and cameras he used, along with moving images of other works. Audiences can see how the works in the exhibition were actually shown in magazines and pictorials. Looking into Kang& #39;s oeuvre through the exhibition, his works tend to cover subjects that could be easily objectified such as regions, public, individuals and traditional styles. Yet, the reason why these topics did not merely become an interesting subject to see was because of the photographer& #39;s attitude that treats them as & #39;something we should not lose,& #39; while identifying the subject and himself. His human documentary pictures the ordinary people for the ordinary people with a warm heart. Then again, these works become a mirror that reflects the Korean society allowing us to envision the social context of the time outside the works.  We hope the exhibition could be an opportunity where you can enjoy the pleasure of the drama in this human theater that reflects various stories of people and read the time and the attitude of the photographer within Korean context.    1.  Picturing the Common Human Theater - Live Documentation of the Contemporary  Presented works in this section capture historic and political events as well as the lives of the people from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Kang Bong Kyu was greatly influenced by meeting Lee Kyoung Mo  at Honam Daily in 1959 who was known for his emblematic reportage works. Then Kang also served as a reporter and director of photography department at Jeonnam Daily. Photographs selected and distributed through newspapers were empowered and functioned as & #39;official memories.& #39; Being onsite, Kang participated in not just as a simple observer but as a member of the society. Dynamically and vividly documenting crucial moments of ordinary people, Kang delivers the & #39;heart of the people& #39; that goes beyond the & #39;official memories.& #39;  1. Picturing the Common Human Theater - Stories of Our People Presented works in this section focus on th lives of individuals, which is a thematic approach he pursued from the 1960s to the 2000s. Through & #39;pictures of faces& #39; combined with stories that could be seen in & #39;100 People& #39; from the magazine Jeonil-graph issued in the 1970s, magazine Lives of Our People that presented faces of Koreans and Time That Never Stopped which captured the elderly of an outback town, Kang relays an image that is much more dramatic than the story. While he was influenced by life realism, Kang also studied the essential part of humans such as faces with the traces of time and their changes according to regional environment. Different from modern photo-portraits, these human documentary displayed with key objects are images that allow the intervention of the interaction between the photographer and the subject, inviting audiences to actively engage with the story.  1. Picturing the Common Human Theater - Regional Style and Spirit  Works from the 1960s to the 1990s presented here exhibit the traditional life style that has been disappearing. In Korean society during modernization, industrialization and globalization, individuals and society became separated under the dual system of the traditional spiritual culture and materialistic structuralization of the society. Tradition to the detached individual meant stability, home and the nostalgia for those that are dying. Display of works adopt various compositions, bringing about integrity within itself. It also represents the tradition which was more recognized as something & #39;behind& #39; and thus & #39;needed to be developed& #40;through New Town Movement, for example& #41;& #39; as an essential image of Koreans through pictorial publications such as Hometown of Koreans and Face of Koreans.  2. Delivering the Origin of the Images: Generational Memories  Works in this section present the harmony of traditional festivals including street rituals and exorcism, the people and the nature. These lyrical and typical Korean images that demonstrate the spirit of Koreans are those that were shared by the generation that lived the same time and are now conveyed to the next generation through the media in a broader sense.    3. Photographer as the Producer and Editor  Archive including magazines and pictorial publications published by Kang and cameras that he used along with screenings of works& #40;from 1960s to 2000s& #41; that are not displayed.  The photographer& #39;s attitude is an element that needs to be put into consideration especially at a time when phenomena are delivered, understood and remembered via certain media and symbols. As an editor and director of human documentaries since the 1960s which were addressed to the public through the media in a broad sense including newspapers, magazines and other publications, Kang has been the producer and messenger of memory and discourse.

498,335,2016 Title Match : Ju Jae Hwan vs. Kim Dong Kyu ,Starry violence dart starlight ,SeMA Buk-Seoul Museum of Art Exhibition Hall 1 ,2016-07-26,2016-10-16,,,,,Free,,,,,"Bringing together an established artist of the Korean art world alongside an emerging artist from the next generation, SeMA, Buk Seoul Museum of Art presents Title Match, an exhibition that seeks intergenerational dialogues, promoting mutual growth.  For the third of the representative annual exhibition series by the Buk Seoul Museum of Art, 2016 Title Match invites Ju Jae Hwan (1941~), who voices with his own unique humor while transcending various media and genres, and Kim Dong Kyu (1978~), who reflects keen insights in his works by concentrating on products from contemporary society that are rapidly consumed and discarded.  With the subtitle 'starry violence, dark starlight,' the exhibition draws artistic conversations across all ages and times, with the subject of 'violence' that prevails in our society. By observing the ways in which the two artists understand and interpret this pan-generational theme, the exhibition attempts to observe the possibility of solidarity and reconciliation between generations, despite their differences.  Consisting of newly produced works under the shared theme of ‘violence,’ the exhibition unfolds an interesting contrast of works that reflect different perspectives and attitudes, like the gap between the two artists from different generations. While the established artist Ju Jae Hwan focuses on forms of macro violence (like the never-ending wars, terror, and conflict on earth since the beginning of history), the artist from the next generation, Kim Dong Kyu, focuses on forms of micro violence that permeate the everyday landscape. .    Ju Jae Hwan reveals a reality where the power of life is overshadowed by the power of death, where human life is taken lightly and people are killed by armed conflict. Composed of objects and images symbolizing conflicts and casualties, documentation of the recent practice of disarmament and peace organizations, and cartoons from a Palestinian editorial cartoonist, Ju’s new works speak to our reflection and introspection towards a reality where we become indifferent to an ever-intensifying violence.    Kim Dong Kyu has persistently focused and explored the inherent meanings of the products of contemporary society that rapidly lose their utility and are discarded. In this exhibition, he reveals an everyday violence that becomes the environment of our society ? a violence that becomes unrecognizable through works that include installations, videos, and drawings that employ the online medium, advertising inflatables, national flags and school mottos hung on walls, and letters of apology.   Although belonging to different generations, the two artists’ works are completed as a collaborative process that contests and harmonizes within the space. Their attitude and ways of developing works about the themes of violence expose their inherent dispositions as well as reflect characteristics from their own generations. Furthermore, the exhibition expresses the current state of our society ― where different generations live together. Through this exhibition, where the viewer can observe an everyday violence (ubiquitous parts of our lives which become almost invisible) alongside the tremendous scale of violence (like in war), we wish to provide an opportunity for viewers to recognize the omnipresent violence all around us.

497,334,Excavation Project with northeastern art colleges,Neighbors and Strangers,"SeMA, Buk-Seoul Museum of art Exhibition Hall 2",2016-07-22,2016-10-16,,,,,Free,,,,,"In its pursuit as a community-friendly museum, SeMA, Buk-Seoul Museum of Art presents Excavation project with northeastern art colleges: Neighbors and Strangers. As part of the locally based project of the 5 districts of northeastern Seoul, where the Buk-Seoul Museum of Art belongs, the exhibition showcases a project carried out in the form of a workshop, by inviting graduate students from local art schools. For this project, each school organizes a class or a sort of task force (TF) with a mentor; each team chooses one of five Gu (district), investigates the region, and produces a collaborative work based on the research. The participating teams had a series of meetings with museum staffs, art critics as well as residents and other people concerned, and refined their work through workshops and a mentoring process.  The exhibition’s subtitle ‘Neighbors and Strangers’ focuses on the fact that although the 5 districts in northeastern Seoul are the bases of life and a foundation for living, the regions are still very unknown and unfamiliar spaces and milieus to the articipating museums, members of the schools, and the audience. This implies a current state where there is a gap between museum, local residents, and audiences. There are also various views that intermingle, originating from the different stances―or the lack (or limits) of communication between various subjects. The participating six teams discovered and examined these current issues and problems within the given areas of northeast Seoul―especially in Nowon-gu, Dobonggu, and Seongbuk-gu―, and visualized their research with various attitudes and methods based on their different interpretations of community art. Each practice is the visual outcome of a process-oriented production that emphasizes building relationships with local residents and collaboration throughout the entire process―from planning to selecting the region, finding subject matter, and producing work.   Beginning before the opening of the exhibition, most of the works on view will be completed or expanded through communication with residents, and furthered through their participation and engagement during the exhibition period. Through this process, each work provides an opportunity to find an undiscovered communal sensibility hidden behind the systems of society, as well as discovering disregarded and overlooked local issues. The exhibition is also meaningful as an opportunity to see, through the perspectives of young prospective artists, the status quo of community art that can be interpreted differently, depending on one’s stance, which can also sometimes be felt as ambiguous. In collaboration with neighboring art colleges, professors and graduate students, SeMA, Buk-Seoul Museum of Art’s Excavation project with northeastern art colleges: Neighbors and Strangers is the first attempt to overcome the limits of communication between various subjectivities in local communities. It will also find its significance in discovering promising emerging artists.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192846_4231a88cc7cd4506ac02d629175fba9e_7b8fb59c787d4fcab2c347da5a49dd6c,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=497,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The artists included in this exhibition undergo much contemplation, questions, and process until reaching ‘something’ they want to deliver. This process is similar as the mumbling of an endless series of adjectives. This exhibition does not function to deliver perfect meaning, but works as a rite of passage and a record of the waves that fluctuate inside artists who break thick layers.  The exhibition title employs both “shy” and “shameful,” signifying the shyness of revealing something unfinished in its raw state, as well as the conditioning of the external environment that might cause one to feel shame. The artists are consistently injected with education and cultural programing that produces standards, making one feel shame when revealing embarrassing parts or the process as it is. Moreover, the social system that requires one to recite overly perfected sentences forces the artist to produce something that does not sway from its legitimized status. The beginning point of <Shy/Shameful, Trivial/Trifling> is to completely reveal the trivial process of thinking that is usually regarded as unnecessary to expose. Here, some artists have more interest in the process of producing artworks, and other artists focus on the process of retracing the history of the artwork from a diachronic perspective.  In this exhibition, Youngju KWON displays drawings and notes, which serve as the foundation and record for his works over the past 8 years. He has freely written sentences or words, full of bluff and errors and embarrassing expressions, resulting in a concentration of a lively and raw energy. Retracing these shameful and trivial traces that were never shown before, the artist himself matures while hinting to the spectators what he is up to next.  Dorothy M Yoon, who works in various media, with an interest in the boundary condition deeply divided, exhibits a digital collage work titled ‘Honey.’ The digital image is hard to read because it is covered with a mosaic like glass, causing important parts to be cut out. This double haze leads spectators to infer trivial and personal stories from the image.  Yusam Sung displays various old and current works in the space that is set up like a studio. The works from the past include projects that were not presented to the public with the numerous drawings made for the project. In this exhibition, he explores how old and current works are related, tracing the process of the works’ transformation, and how it can be the motivation to better understand current works and new processes.  Ji Hye Yeom, who has great interests in specific places, represents ‘Earth Tunnel Project’, a work she produced in 2010 but decided not to display because she herself measured it had failed, and ‘Untitled Project,’ a newly produced work for this exhibition. Through these two works, the artist contemplates the meaning of project that implies ‘protrusion’ and ‘reflection’ along signifiers like ‘curation’ and ‘task,’ and explores to the possibilities of a perfect deliberation of meaning in the works.  Taewon Heo exhibits ‘Untitled’ (Palm Lines Painting, 2014), a work that reflects on the artist’s personal hopes of feeling an existence through the production process, and ‘Laundry’(2008 - present), which reveals an individual life through the records of lethargic and incomplete days. Because the artist was taught that it was shameful to open up a personal narrative in her own works, the artist presents personal works in a serious manner, which were rejected in final evaluation and exhibition) that might be meaningful only for the artist.  Seunghee Hong continues ‘Force to Depth’ since 2007, a work that expresses the meaning of life and its weight, using wrinkles to express this depth. In that space, wrinkles and their significations express the matter’s gravity, which was forcefully taken away, with intuitive thinking. The drawing series for the exhibition embeds the artist’s personal sense and views as necessary products for completed works, along with the records of various experimental attempts.  For the past few months, these six artists have gone on a journey to find something of their own and have spent much time together sharing their trivial and frank stories. During the process, some artists embarked towards something more concrete, while others are still struggling to find that something. At the moment of writing this text, I am not sure how <Shy/Shameful, Trivial/Trifling> will turn out and how it will appear to spectators (this might just be the uncertainty of an artist who suddenly decides to curate). But the one thing that is clear is that it will be a platform that inevitably captures the process of each artist, who breaks away from their box and creates their own narrative.

This exhibition brings together six artists with diverse backgrounds and practices to show works which they have produced during their residency period in Seoul. Drawing on new experiences, employing local materials and craftsmanship, each work individually negotiates its relevance to the site of its creation. Using their time in Korea to gain a new vantage point from which to re-examine the questions and ideas which drive their practices, the artists have created works in the media of installation, sculpture, film, performance and drawing.  The exhibition's title, 'Meeting in Two Circles', draws upon the idiosyncratic exhibition space and its unique architecture. It marks the coming together of six previously unrelated artists to share a time and space during their joint residency, and their collaboration to create a group exhibition in which their works inevitably enter into unforeseen relationships with each other.  ■ SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY<br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>OPENING:6.16.THUR. 5PM",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2F2016%2Fmgimg%2Fimg31%2Feng%2F&FILE_NM=pfile2016_1468563834724.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835225,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Considering that Fluxus ? a happening art movement that took place in the 1960s as well as Paik’s artistic companions, was the root of Paik’s art practice, the exhibition illuminates Fluxus with Nam June Paik.    The title of the exhibition, NamJunePaik∞ Fluxus implies the infinite relations between Nam June Paik and Fluxus, which influenced and connected with each other like a Mobius strip. The exhibition largely consists of two sections: NamJunePaikis∞ and Fluxusis∞, both will present works and archival materials from Nam June Paik and Fluxus. Furthermore, works in Participation Gallery ―which will be activated by audience participation―, and Danish Fluxus member Eric Anderson’s CryingSpace will add more meanings to the memorial exhibition.  Nam June Paik is ∞ introduces collections from SeMA as well as video sculptures and installations from Bremen Kunsthalle, Germany, domestic Korean corporations, and individual collectors. Meanwhile, Fluxusis∞ presents documents from happenings and works of main Fluxus members including John Cage, Joseph Beuys, George Maciunas, Dick Higgins, Alison Knowles, Benjamin Peterson, and Yoko Ono.   Without any determinant start or end points, the audience can freely view more than 200 pieces of works installed in various spaces: NamJunePaikis∞ and Fluxusis∞ (the left and right rooms of the special exhibition gallery on the 3rdfloor),ParticipationGallery(Project Gallery), and CryingSpaces(Crystal Room). Here, the audience can commemorate and enjoy the works of Nam June Paik, with pieces that still give us immeasurable aesthetic pleasure, from this figure who is still close to our minds and hearts even though ten years have passed since his death.

488,329,Memorial Exhibition of Chun Kyung-ja (1924 ~ 2015) : The Wind May Blow It Blows Anyway ,,SeMA Seosomun Museum of Art  2F,2016-06-14,2016-08-07,,,,,Free,,,,,"Chun Kyung-ja (1924 ~ 2015) is a representative female artist and a great star of the Korean art scene. She established her own world of artworks with her unique figurative style, at a time in the modern Korean art scene that was dominated by abstract art. On August 6, 2015, she eternally passed away, to the unknown world that constantly appears in her works.       Wishing that her works were preserved all together to present to the audience forever, in 1998 the artist donated 93 major works which she treasured like her alter ego, as well as the copyright to all the works to the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Memorial Exhibition of Chun Kyung-ja (1924 ~ 2015) : The Wind May Blow It Blows Anyway is prepared in honor of the artist’s achievements at the 1st anniversary of her death. The exhibition displays all of her donated works, in addition to works from private collections, and the artist’s archives including writings, photos, news articles, illustrations, and video. The subtitle of the exhibition is cited from the artist’s book Liberal Woman (Jiphyeonjeon, 1979) : “The wind may blow. It blows anyway. We do not know where the wind comes from and where it goes. A life might be floating on that wind.” These words intend to share the artist’s unique poetic sensibility?one who has encountered joys and sorrows of a life ingenuously every moment.       The exhibition is constituted in 4 sections: Life, Journey, Fantasy, and Archive. The ‘Life’ section exhibits Chun Kyung-ja’s iconic self-portraits and images of women, including 'Solitude' (1974), 'The 22nd Page of My Sad Legend' (1977), and 'Since It Has Closed' (1989) with her student works at the Women’s College of Fine Arts in Tokyo and 'Life Form' (1951), which was painted to endure the period of social and personal confusion after the Korean War. In the ‘Journey’ section, artworks labeled as ‘Travel Paintings’ during the 1970s to the 1980s are presented. Most of those works are highly dense landscape paintings and sketches that are based on inspiration from her travels in different countries including Africa, Europe, South America, India and the United States. They manifest different aspects of Chun Kyung-ja, an artist who is usually known to depict the major subject matter of flowers and women. Lastly, the ‘Fantasy’ section presents her manifestation of an unknown world and the afterlife which she imagined. In this section, exhibited works from the 1960s, made with dreamlike colors and strong brush strokes include works such as 'Invocation of the Spirit of the Dead' (1965), 'White Night' (1966), as well as the unfinished work 'Fantasy Journey' (1955). Particularly, in 'Fantasy Journey' (1955), spectators might observe the artist’s intense process of her works in repeatedly erasing and painting over.       Chun Kyung-ja once mentioned that she liked the phrase, “life of incompleteness,” implying this progressive condition, because dreams disappear when reaching their completion. Through this exhibition, we expect the audience to find the opportunity to confront challenge and healing by encountering the dreams and fantasies which she pursued without stop, and her creative will to paint original works all the time even in moments of suffering.

481,325,Art in Society - Land of Happiness,,"Buk Seoul Museum of Art Hall 1,2",2016-05-10,2016-07-06,,,,,,,,,,"Art in Society?Land of Happiness is based on the warp and woof of historical universality and the artists’ attitudes towards the society and art, who are in the specific political and social circumstances of Korea. The exhibition sheds new lights on ‘Minjung Art'  which was an avant-garde art movement in the period of socio-political transformation of the 1980s, based on themes timely to the contemporary society we are living in. Also, focusing on the works of contemporary artists that try experiments that are aesthetic but also social, and carry messages of resistance, the exhibition also looks into the avant-garde attitude that passes through generations.  Presenting the historic works of Minjung Art that autonomously emerged under the socio-political circumstances of Korea in the 1980s along with the new trend found in the works of the group of artists who concern the epistemology and ontology of art with social consciousness since the 1990s. The exhibition provides understanding of what the title names “Art in Society” which includes art of life, participatory art, communicative art, resistant art and political art.  As much as the age and generation of the artists or media and forms they take differ, the works resented in the exhibition aries considerably. Yet, at a closer look, heir works imply a bond of sympathy that hrough social intervention, critical utterance and alternative suggestions, art can play a role in seeking universal coexistence. This ould be what the exhibition title, “Land of Happiness,” eventually implicates.

479,324,Lee JuYong Photographic Studio,,Buk Seoul Museum of Art Project Gallery 1-2,2016-05-03,2016-08-15,,,,,,,,,,"In a time when we are indifferent to the production and consumption of images, Buk Seoul Museum of Art presents Lee JuYong Photographic Studio, an exhibition that represents the gradually disappearing photographic studio in the museum space. Collecting thousands of photographs and cameras over the past 30 years, Lee JuYong considers early photographs as a record of society and culture of the time. He has carried out an archiving project that systematically categorizes the images. Through Lee JuYong’s photography practice that explores time, history, memory, and identity based on the archive, the exhibition attempts to communicate the meaning of portrait photography as an important image since the modern era, and tell stories of the people in the photographs.   Following the invention of photography, portrait photography enabled people of every class to possess their own portraits, which was once the exclusive property of the privileged class. In Korea, portrait photography was popularized in the early 1900s as photo studios emerged in the Joseon Dynasty. Taking the early photography studio as a motif, the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project is an actual photo studio built in project gallery 1, and serves as a space for taking portrait photographs. Lee JuYong Photographic Studio also consists of People on the Road ― portrait photographs produced using early studio photography techniques ― in project gallery 2.  The Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project is a participatory documentation project of portrait photography based on the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio, an important photography studio in Korean photography history. A studio run by Koreans, the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio strove to spread and popularize photography since it opened in 1907. Centering on the portrait photography studio for audiences’ voluntary participation, the project consists of early portrait photographs and portraits from modern times in Korea, China, and Japan selected from Lee’s archive. Lee’s recent work Memory of the Moment (2015) employs early photographic process. The Portrait Documentation Project will be undertaken by the artist with a specific group of people during the exhibition period.   As a backdrop for the photography studio, Lee placed a piece by Rhaomi Painting featuring pleasure-seeking moments(2016), which visualizes the universal hopes of human beings, such as wealth and honor, power, and the flourishing of one’s decedents. Juxtaposing various props in front of the backdrop, Lee represents the archetype of the modern photography studio from today’s perspective. Leading us to a fantasy world where the past and present coexist, Lee JuYong’s photography studio enables the audience to experience monumental moments in our banal routine and voluntarily records the special moments in our lives. Capturing a moment of a subject and fixing it on photographic paper, portrait photography might be a product of human desire as evident in portrait photographs from early photography history and in those from modern Korea, China, and Japan. These photographs might be a projection of early photographers’ wish to bring the practice of painting into photography, and exhibit people’s desire to show their existence and impose the eternal into existence. In this sense, Lee’s photography studio represents the here and now, and serves as a space for realizing the desires of its visitors while escaping from reality.        Lee’s Memory of the Moment series captures objects and spaces using early photographic processes of ambrotype and tintype. The series is suggestive of the activities of the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project, which records the present moment in the form of the past. Additionally, early portrait photographs and portraits from modern Korea, China, and Japan recuperate the traces and memories of people in modern times when they lived in the mixed influences of the three countries. Through these images of the past, the audience experiences the past and the memory of the time. In the mixed time and space spanning from early photography to the present, the Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project talks about the history of human life, including our contemporaries, by bringing the past and its memory into the present.   Lee JuYong has mainly taken photographs of objects using early photographic processes that require extended periods of time and serious concentration. These works were attempts to find the inherent essence and archetype of objects rather than their appearance. Lee’s focus switched from objects to humans in People on the Road, a series of 21 photographs of sanitation workers produced through ‘Portraits Project of Public Service Workers of Seoul’ with the support of the Seoul Museum of Art and the Seoul Metropolitan Government Employees’ Union. Lee took portraits of people in the same occupation using traditional early studio photography techniques and attempted to extract each person’s individuality and project their interiority as well as appearance onto the image.    This exhibition is a significant turning point both in content and form in Lee JuYoung’s work. The Cheonyoundang Photographic Studio Art Project is presented as an open space that is completed by the participation of the audience. Taking a step further from People on the Road, the artist conducts a project that records the portrait of citizens born before 1932 who lived through modern and contemporary Korea. Lee’s new attempt is very meaningful in that he is beginning to create a social document of our contemporaries beyond the recording of our past history. Through the exhibition LeeJuYong Photographic Studio held in the Buk Seoul Museum of Art, we hope to offer an opportunity to appreciate the power of images as revealed in portrait photographs, and recognize the stories of the people represented in the images.

Seven international artists selected by the two institutions, crossing over boundaries of gender, nationality and culture, will unfold creative initiatives filled with imaginations based on the urban experience from Seoul and Paris. Their insights from productively misreading the deviating interpretations and misunderstanding caused by limited conditions and environments such as the physical distance between the two cities, psychological and cultural differences, and language barrier create intriguing legends of their own.

Selected from the collections of two globally recognized institutions, the Centre national des arts plastiques(CNAP) and Fonds r?gional d’art contemporain Aquitaine (Frac Aquitaine), the exhibition presents 210 contemporary photographs taken after the 1950s.  The Family of the Invisibles commemorates the 100th anniversary of the birth of the French philosopher Roland Barthes (1915-1980). The exhibition has its anchor in the theory of photography in Camera Lucida, an iconic book written by Barthes which had a significant influence on photography, contemporary art, cultural discourse, and epistemology. Based on Barthes’ idea which paid attention to invisible and marginalized beings, the exhibition criticizes the notion of an imaginary community of mankind, which was previously presented in The Family of Man held at the MoMA in 1955. The exhibition also deconstructs mythical elements embedded in contemporary society.   The Family of the Invisibles will be hosted at SeMA and Ilwoo Space; the latter is affiliated with the Hanjin Business Group. The exhibition at Ilwoo Space presents black and white photographs taken in the 1950s, which will be the prologue to SeMA’s exhibition, presenting contemporary photographs taken after the 1970s. By presenting the exhibition in two institutions, spectators would be able to explore the interesting intersection between Barthes’ theory and contemporary photographs, as well as grasp the meaning of the photo collections of Cnap and Frac Aquitaine.

Like living organisms, cars have life cycles in which they are created, used, and disposed. Through the continuous repetition of this life cycle, cars have produced and represented a range of different concepts in our society, including modernization, speed, freedom and human desires to consume. In this sense, cars are our companions that transform our ways of life and attitude towards life. brilliant memories: with is an exhibition co-organized by Seoul Museum of Art and Hyundai Motor Company with the goal of introducing these novel, expanded meanings of cars in our society. As hinted in the title of the exhibition “with,” we aim to open up opportunities for the audience to confirm the special journey of companionship between cars and humans through artworks created with contemporary artists’ imaginations and creativity. We also hope to urge the audience to think outside the frame of simply defining cars based on their practical functions and encourage them to understand cars as vehicles through which we interact with our own lives, society, history, reality and the world. Twelve participating artists have produced artworks by drawing inspirations from cars that are nearing disposal. Some works show the life of the car owner and invite the audience to look into the owner’s memories of the car. Other works convey various messages including thoughts on human emotions, insight on life and cultural differences, based on personal experiences tied to cars, while other works are artistic reinterpretations of abstract concepts such as industrialization, journey and mobility. In the process of artistic recreation, cars take on the role of man’s creative companions. At the same time, they become objects that narrate the stories of our lives, reflect our society and help us interact with the world.  brilliant memories: with aims to expand the audience’s understanding of cars that have become a part of our lives. We hope that this exhibition will help you take the definition of the car beyond its practical function and rediscover cars as life-long companions of artists, visitors and everyone in the world.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192847_28e23825fcb342b98549c4035b8abdec_bbc9750bbbeb4a6383cc571a61b810ec,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=467,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

These utensils have undergone many transformations to the present day due to various reasons, such as the history of food culture, scientific discoveries, the mixture of civilizations, and so on. Expanding their observations on flatware, the participating artists of Eating Tools present various stories of food culture and flatware through diverse media, including craft, design, video, installation, sculpture, and painting, etc. All sorts of interests in flatware have come together, from master artisans, artists who continuously seek the aesthetics and daily use of flatware, to the transformation of, and a twist in function.  Eating Tools are divided into five sections: Human, Making, Style, Usage, and Life. Each section represents the contemplation of flatware in a circular structure. The 'Human' section shows stories of being and self-contemplation that flatware reveals. The 'Making' section displays the story of obsessiveness in creation to achieve the flatware's function, while the 'Style' section presents the story of aesthetics that exceeds material and technique. Stories that surpass our expectations for flatware and their usage are revealed in the 'Usage' section, and the value of socialization and tools for living are exposed in the 'Life' section.   Eating Tools is an extension of William Morris’s attempt at an art within life, or the unification of art and life, originating more than 200 years ago. This exhibition enables viewers to think about what ‘making’ essentially means to humans, as well as how objects reflect and relate to the zeitgeist and taste of material culture.

Borrowing this concept, we titled SeMA NANJI 9th Review as <Experiment & Expression (九思九容)> by substituting the original meaning of mental attitude in ‘九思’ with experimental attitude of artists, and demeanor in ‘九容’ with artistic expression. Thus, <Experiment & Expression (九思九容)> implies that the 9th term artists of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY deeply contemplated, explored, and repeated numerous experiments which are expressed through their works’ complexity. Also, the number ‘9’ in Asian culture is regarded as the fullest number to express in this life. In fact the number 9 character in Chinese writing (九) is pronounced the same as 具 (to possess). It also implies perfection, which we intended to reflect in the exhibition title. Thus, ‘九思九容’ in the exhibition title means the perfect works of the artist, as well as that it is the 9th outcomes of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY  after our journey with them.  SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY is the residency program operated by Seoul Museum of Art. It is the creative space where young artists reside and produce artworks, as well as being an active field within the art world where diverse artistic experiments, research, exhibitions, and exchanges take place. Inaugurated in 2006, SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY has undergone many changes and improvements, which culminates in today’s 9th program. It is now able to provide the resident artists a more systematic program. Among the programs, the ‘NANJI ART SHOW’ is an exhibition the resident artists plan and operate by themselves by sharing their field of interest. They collaborate based on various topics, and create exhibitions in new formats. Also, during the research program ‘Art Critic Workshop’, the artists discuss their work from diverse perspectives with critics, and participate in producing a creative theory of their work. Through this process, the artists may improve their work with more depth in terms of content and expression.  Artists reason through sensuous thinking or intuitive sensibility rather than logical thinking.

The expressions may reveal the significance of invisible spaces, reflect on the issue of social participation, assign authentic meaning to objects in daily life, crush stereotypes through recycling, expand the domain of art by suggesting new ways of drawing or applying craft skills, express relations formed in multilayers, and utilize new mediums of the current era such as digital technology, sound, or light.   <Experiment & Expression (九思九容)> is the survey of the outcomes of the past year in which the 21 artists of the 9th term of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY have worked on.

Borrowing this concept, we titled SeMA NANJI 9th Review as <Experiment & Expression (九思九容)> by substituting the original meaning of mental attitude in ‘九思’ with experimental attitude of artists, and demeanor in ‘九容’ with artistic expression. Thus, <Experiment & Expression (九思九容)> implies that the 9th term artists of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY deeply contemplated, explored, and repeated numerous experiments which are expressed through their works’ complexity. Also, the number ‘9’ in Asian culture is regarded as the fullest number to express in this life. In fact the number 9 character in Chinese writing (九) is pronounced the same as 具 (to possess). It also implies perfection, which we intended to reflect in the exhibition title. Thus, ‘九思九容’ in the exhibition title means the perfect works of the artist, as well as that it is the 9th outcomes of SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY after our journey with them.   SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY is the residency program operated by Seoul Museum of Art. It is the creative space where young artists reside and produce artworks, as well as being an active field within the art world where diverse artistic experiments, research, exhibitions, and exchanges take place. Inaugurated in 2006, SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY has undergone many changes and improvements, which culminates in today’s 9th program. It is now able to provide the resident artists a more systematic program. Among the programs, the ‘NANJI ART SHOW’ is an exhibition the resident artists plan and operate by themselves by sharing their field of interest. They collaborate based on various topics, and create exhibitions in new formats. Also, during the research program ‘Art Critic Workshop’, the artists discuss their work from diverse perspectives with critics, and participate in producing a creative theory of their work. Through this process, the artists may improve their work with more depth in terms of content and expression.   Artists reason through sensuous thinking or intuitive sensibility rather than logical thinking. At the same time, such a way of reasoning is linked and processed through various experiments while engaged in studies or experimentation. After repeating, actualizing, and abstracting the studies, when the artist feels that it is done, the work is presented to the world as one expression. When comparing such experiments and expressions of the artists to ‘九思’ and ‘九容,’ for 9th term artists, the phrase ‘九思’ is their nine topics: reality, society, daily life, art, ideology, experience, emotion, generation, and tradition, while the phrase ‘九容’ is the result of the nine expressions on that topics.

The exhibition was conceived to shed light on the practices and approaches of these alternative communities as a phenomenon in which they either run independent spaces in between the niches at the outskirt of the city or lead ephemeral collaborative projects.   70 artists from 15 artist-or-curator based exhibition platforms in the show include artists that present various forms of practices, from groups that showcase their works based on a physical space, collectives devoted to temporary and fragmented collaborations based on online or SNS to small design studios that are recently on the rise.   Seoul Babel is the symbol of the young and experimental movements made by these art platforms in the city which let us recognize the existence of differences, using their own individual language. By supporting these independent and organic moves of the curators and artists which are the real capillaries of the growth of art, Seoul Museum of Art will be highlighting its social role, network and publicness as an art institution and take the lead in expanding the foundation of art.

From the past until the present, this exhibition traces the history of the former Belgian Consulate. Built during the Daehan Empire era, it is now used as the SeMA, Nam-Seoul Living Arts Museum.  This year has a great significance because the building marks its 110th anniversary. In 2004, the former Belgian Consulate was remodeled as the Nam Seoul Annex Building of SeMA and was mostly used as white cube spaces. After the building was programmed into a living arts museum, it has undergone restoration work. Through this work, visitors can come to appreciate the original architectural features of the building.     Evolved Museum: the former Belgian Consulate consists of two sections: An architectural section that analyzes the building’s history and character, and an art section that offers a reinterpretation of the building and its surrounding environment by artists. Based on serious research and study, a historian of Korean modern architecture, Ahn Changmo, organizes the architectural section as a guest curator. Through the exhibition and a symposium, the achievement of these efforts summons the unknown past into the present. Additionally, as the architectural firm ONE O ONE FACTORY and Ko Joohwan have participated in the restoration of the cultural property, the exhibition contains collaborations between the field of history, architecture and cultural property.    Meanwhile, Sangdon Kim, Noh Sangho, IM Heung-soon, Chang Hwa-jin, Shan Hur, and SSAV group participate in the art section. Through various genres including painting, sculpture, video, photography, and installation, from today’s perspective and by extending the topography to surrounding areas such as Sadang and Namhyeon-dong the artists activate the multi-layered meanings of the building across its history, culture, and society.  Evolved Museum: the former Belgian Consulate will provide a unique opportunity to encounter the historic value of the unknown Belgian Consulate as well as its current significance as a museum.

Embracing not only pure art, but also the related fields of architecture, film, design, etc., and espousing the value of multimedia, post-genreism, and convergence in contemporary art, following the Tim Burton Exhibition in 2012, SeMA has the opportunity to present the world of Stanley Kubrick's works to the Korean public.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the most influential directors in film history, famous for his innovative cinematography. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), now regarded as a benchmark for special effects, shows strikingly realistic visuals, so much so that it is hard to believe that the film was produced before the first moon landing. With ceaseless experimentation, challenges, and ground-breaking ideas, Kubrick produced films like A Clockwork Orange (1971), Barry Lyndon (1975), The Shining (1980), Full Metal Jacket (1987), and Eyes Wide Shut (1999) that remain as crucial films in cinema history.  To further immerse viewers in the world of Stanley Kubrick, this exhibition enriches the narratives on a spectacular scale, and with formative stagecraft, has blurred the lines between cinematic and visual art. As he considered music to be a significant cinematic device, soundtracks will be played in the exhibition halls to preserve Kubrick's intent and allow the audience to actually “feel” his masterpieces. In addtion, over a thousand items from the archives are on display, such as research materials, photographs, scripts, letters, film, props, costumes, cameras, and lenses left by the director during his lifetime of film production. Through the precious resources which display the perfectionist process of his production, one can see the profound world and diligence that Kubrick pursued as an artist, so massively influential in the field of visual art.  After its first opening in Frankfurt, Germany in 2004, the Stanley Kubrick Exhibition has been widely acclaimed during its tour in cities all over the world. As the first to host the exhibition in Asia, SeMA hopes to inspire creativity and a spirit of adventure, and to further provide a unique artistic experience into the world of Stanley Kubrick, not only to children and adolescents, but to general public and experts as well. We greatly appreciate the contributions of Deutsches Filmmuseum, Hyundai Card, and GNC Media for their cooperation in realizing the exhibition, and we thank you, the public, for your interest and support.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_8d00ce3f4f4848b5a97743a5748f9fd8_86cb46f549d547478b83bbea603d6819,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=444,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

I wanted to make them 'present' in my paintings, rather than to be 'repres     ented'.”  LEE Hyunbae, 2015  All my works are about finding aesthetics from unexpected traces that I specially produced. I normally make each background with lots of turpentine or watery Korean traditional ink. The runny paint flows onto the canvas and leaves certain traces naturally. I use a hair dryer to blow and dry the background. The traces without any brush-stroke have new shapes through the intentional control, they become something that can give other associations and inspirations. They exist on their own positions both neither submerging, nor emerging on the canvas. This shows my own self which is floating neither submerging nor emerging and un-mixable between Eastern and Western self.   Although there is no law or rule of art making in this contemporary art scene, I believe in that every artwork has its own answer. Even If there is no ‘answer’, there will be ‘the best’ at least. The accidental effect of background image provides me the great hint to solve the question which is called an art work.  The residency in New Zealand and Whitireia were perfect circumstances that I could completely focus on my work. Unfamiliar volcanic geography, clear sea, the very strong contrast of the sun light of winter and long visible distance with the clean air, they opened new perspective to me. I could grope for a new direction of my work with these stimulation from the new environment, and develop my ideas through positive conversations with many people.

428,300,RE-PLAY: 4 PLATFORMS & 17 EVENTS,,Seoul Museum of Art  1F,2015-10-20,2015-12-13,,,,,FREE,"ARCHITECTURE, INSTALLATION, MOVING IMAGES, ACTIVIETIES",,,,"Under the vision of the ‘Post Museum,’ Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) has pursued the place for the audience, communication with the public, and collaborations with other genres. With the theme of ‘unused space’ that has recently been a main issue with the urban regeneration policy, SeMA presents Re-Play: 4 Platforms & 17 Events, an experimental project that revitalizes ‘unused space’ into cultural spaces in local hubs.  The concept of ‘urban regeneration,’ which came from the West since the 1980s, includes revitalizing post-industrial city through cultural activities and urban cultural policies established to improve the image of underdeveloped city. Since the 2000s, Korea also began to revitalize grafting unused facilities through culture with the idea of ‘Creative City.’ However, in the process of urban regeneration using old and empty buildings, it was evident that these projects lacked consideration for its users and the local communities. Also it can be pointed that the studies for cultural programs and content to induce user’s active participation were also insufficient. It is necessary to prepare museum programs and activities to help the audience and local communities to participate and become the main agent of the cultural activities.  This exhibition is a stage to explore cultural spaces where the audience becomes both the agent and object of cultural activities, experimenting in the possibility of their functions. For this, four architects/teams, NAMELESS Architecture (Unchung Na, Sorae Yoo), Park Cheon Kang x NamIl Joe, Tchely Hyung-Chul SHIN @ shinslab, Keehyun Ahn + Minjae Shin (AnLstudio) propose four platforms that employ the architectural imagination to revitalize (Re-play) temporarily dormant spaces. Artist Soyoung CHUNG approaches the idea of suspended time and the possible dynamism of unused space through her unique formal language.

It is significant because we need to put our heads together and discuss how we should represent, imagine, and connect North Korea as the very close but distant ‘other,’ before it is too late.  NK Project is comprised of 3 sections: A representation of North Korea’s visual culture at-a-glance including oil paintings, posters, and stamps, North Korea’s scenery and people depicted in the photographs of foreign artists, and video and installation art by South Korean artists depicting the subject of North Korea. For the first time shown in South Korea are parts of a collection of North Korean oil paintings from Dutch collector Ronald de Groen, posters from Dutch collector Willem van der Bijl, and stamps from Korean collector Donghuyn Shin. In the past North Korean art shown in South Korea solely focused on Chos?nhwa (the traditional paintings of the Chosun era), this exhibition will be an opportunity to encounter diverse aspects of North Korean art seen through the broad spectrum of visual culture.  The exhibition introduces foreign photographers, Nick Danziger from the U.K., Eddo Hartman from Netherlands, and Wang Guofeng from China. Their photographs taken after 2010, which depict architecture of city, landscape, and people, present current scenes of North Korea. Representing South Korean artists, we have invited prominent figures who are well-known for producing North Korean themed works such as Ikjoong Kang, Chankyung Park, Suntag Noh, Yongbeck Lee, Sun Moo, who has been active in South Korean art world as a North Korean defector, and younger emerging artists Hayoon Kwon and Sojung Jun. Through these seven South Korean artists who combine their artistic imagination of North Korea with their sharp awareness of reality, we expect the spectrum of the exhibition NK Project will be broadened.    Through NK Project’s three sections that include the vision of the artist, perspectives of foreigner, and visual culture of North Korea, we try to suggest a mapping that three different views exchanges as if having a conversation with each other. Moreover, we expect the audience in the exhibition space can feel these exchanges of views, mix their own views with them, and actively expand and explore the discourse and ideas.

425,296,NOT Untitled  Chang-Jin Lee,,"Buk Seoul Museum of Art  Photo Gallery 1, 2 ",2015-09-22,2015-12-13,,,,,,,,,,"The project is based on Artist Chang-Jin Lee’s interviews (2008-2012) in 7 different countries, with Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese, Indonesian, Filipino, and Dutch 'comfort women' survivors and a former Japanese soldier from W.W.II.  It brings to light the memory of 200,000 young women, referred to as 'comfort women,' who were systematically exploited as sex slaves in Asia during World War II, and increases awareness of sexual violence against women during wartime.  The gathering of women to serve the Imperial Japanese Army was organized on an industrial scale not seen before in modern history. This project promotes awareness of these women, some of whom are still alive today, and brings to light a history which has been largely forgotten and denied.  Whenever there's a war we hear about the suffering of soldiers, yet we hear almost nothing about the plight of women who are kidnaped and raped, or killed. Often it is the poorest and most marginalized elements of society who suffer most. Through out history women like this are too often invisible, forgotten and left with no place to turn.  Historian Suzanne O'Brien has written that  'the privileging of written documents works to exclude from history...the voices of the kind of people comfort women represent - the female, the impoverished, the colonized, the illiterate, and the racially and ethnically oppressed. These people have left few written records of their experiences, and therefore are denied a place in history.'  The 'Comfort Women System' is considered the largest case of human trafficking in the 20th century. Much in the same way that acknowledgment and awareness of the Holocaust helps to insure it will not happen again, by acknowledging this issue we can prevent another generation of enslaved 'comfort women' from happening anywhere ever again.  In the 21st century, human trafficking has surpassed drug trafficking to become the second largest business in the world after arms dealing. The 'comfort women' issue illustrates the victimization which women suffer in terms of gender, ethnicity, politics, and class oppression, and how women are still perceived as a disposable commodity. This project promotes empowerment of these and all women, and seeks to establish a path toward a future where oppression is no longer tolerated.  Despite growing awareness of the issue of trafficking of women and of sexual slavery as a crime against humanity, this particular recent historical event has gone largely unacknowledged. It attempts to bring to light this instance of organized violence against women, and to create a constructive dialogue for the future by acknowledging their place in history.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192848_6edf927f75464be7ae5cb67d8567659a_1c1ca17d3dea427a9a8e6abcb9742062,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=425,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Perhaps the most conspicuous scenes of downtown life will be of people using their portable mobile devices, such as Smartphones, as they walk along sidewalks, travel on the subway or dine in a restaurant. This exhibition titled ≪DigiFun Art: Urban Scape≫ aims to show how mobile devices and their various applications, which have become more than essential to us, also serve as a new artistic tool for artists; as well as to shed light on creative activities in new fields that have emerged through the various functions of smart devices.   The term ‘DigiFun’ in the title of the exhibition is a compound word made from ‘digital’ and ‘fun.’ Just as the contemporary British artist David Hockney has been creating and presenting a series of iPad drawings since 2009, portable mobile gadgets allow people to engage in creative activities without being limited by place or conventional tools such as brushes or water colors, and fulfill the basic need for novelty and pleasure.   This exhibition can be divided into four sections. ●The first section consists of artworks by six contemporary artists (Kim, yongkwan, Yong-Chul Kim, Park Gwang soo, Fi Jae Lee, Hong Kyoungtack, Hong Seung-Hye), all of whom have chosen mobile digital devices as a new medium for this exhibition. The artists have created works in various genres including sound installations, photo collages, drawings, sheet cuttings and sticker installations, and produced videos using tablet PCs and various applications. ●The second section introduces works by Korean and overseas artists (Hongkyu Kim, Seung Jun Ahn, Jeremy Sutton, Joanne Carter, Susan Murtaugh, J?rge Hinz) who are known as ‘mobile artists’ or ‘iPad artists’ working in a new field created by the development of applications and the functions of mobile devices. These artists create their works - including drawings and photos - using mobile devices while working in a different occupation, and have expanded the field of digital creativity by forming a venue for discussion. ●The third section is a drawing experience space produced in cooperation with Yonsei Institute of Convergence Technology, which allows all visitors alike to participate in artwork. When visitors take photos and draw on the photos, the work titled ‘Pixel Scape,’ which combines digital technology with analogue drawings, transforms the photos into pixel images, and provides an interesting experience that changed simple actions into painting by stimulating the imagination. ●The last section exhibits artworks by thirty-three people who participated in a contest held to show that anyone can create art simply by using a mobile device. It aims to share the voices of various people who have created artworks such as ‘mobile drawings’.   In addition to the exhibition, this event will offer visitors an opportunity to listen to the latest trends in mobile art activities that are being discussed overseas by inviting BBC journalist Joanne Carter, who runs a website about mobile art and mobile photography, as well as Jeremy Sutton, who organizes live drawing performances and workshops at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC, USA and the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, UK. We hope this event will allow visitors to familiarize themselves with various aspects of ‘Digital-fun’ that may be developing or which has already been established as a new trend.     - Exhibition & Lecture : Project Gallery, 3F - Workshop on the 24th : B1 ",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192848_4a5bb62307354a0284b824d6a5c5546d_9db0a63b492447c887620db9581139dc,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=421,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
424,295,East Asia Feminism: FANTasia,,Seoul Museum of Art,2015-09-15,2015-11-08,,,,,Free of charge,,,,,"The Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) will be hosting the exhibition “East Asia Feminism: FANTasia,” an exploration of the current state and implications of East Asian women’s art from a feminist perspective. Within the debates on the intersection of globalization and localism and the issues of gender and reproduction in modern art discourse, the art of Asian women has consistently been a subject of criticism due to its political implications in terms of geography and gender.  From a Western-centric and patriarchal perspective, Asia and women both fall under the category of “invisible other.” This category is also the realm of fantasy, in which charm and intimidation coexist at the border between reality and non-reality. Within this context, this exhibition’s title (FANTasia) was derived as a compound word combining the terms “fantasy” and “Asia.”  Through the diverse works of 14 participating artists from various countries, including Korea, China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and India, visitors are provided the opportunity to heighten their understanding of feminism and learn about the current status of East Asian women’s art.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_a8a45366e93b46f7a55df1a8162bbe83_fed43e6dfbf84d87b6013ca96e70bfae,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=424,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

420,292,Title Match: gum nuri vs Hong Jungpyo,,Buk Seoul Museum of Art ,2015-09-08,2015-11-08,,,,,,,,,,"itle Match is a representative annual exhibition at the Buk Seoul Museum of Art that invites a senior artist who has represented the Korean art world and a younger artist from the 21st century to encourage an inter-generational dialogue. Marking its second year, Title Match: gum nuri vs Hong Jungpyo invites gum nuri (1951~), who has served pioneering roles over various areas of art in the 20th Century Korean art world, and Hong Jungpyo (1976~), a promising artist who has been attracting much attention in the 21st century.   Based on art’s sensitivity, gum nuri has been prominent in all visual art fields ranging from experimental sculpture, installation, performance, and publication. In particular, leading into the second expansion of his avant-garde spirit and artistic soul, was a revolutionary change in his perspective on art and attitude in mid to late 1990s ― this spirit still persists today.   Having grown up in the most contemporary environment, Hong Jungpyo explores fundamental questions about contemporary art and art practices. He experiments between the boundaries of art and daily life, representing the process with his refined artistic language. Consequently, his works maximize a purely formal aesthetic and highlight its formal beauty. Although it plainly reveals the limit of art and artist, it also presents a highly refined work containing the artist’s own unique order.   As the exhibition’s title suggests, this exhibition presents ‘confronting’ artistic viewpoints and work attitudes of the two artists, both who have careers in ‘sculpture,’ working in various mediums such as 2D work, sculpture, installation, and performance. These two artists choose materials and mediums of opposing characters and work in contrasting modes. As their works are displayed in one space, subtle collisions and harmonies are formed.   After being selected, the two artists have completed Title Match through continuous meetings and dialogue. Now we can sense the present state of contemporary art and foresee the future by comparing their works and witnessing the amusing reversal of generational gaps. The exhibition represents the artists just as they are, as a young artist who asks, “what is contemporary art?” and the old artist who freely and candidly answers his question.

Seoul Focus is SeMA’s annual art show that has brought specific aspects of contemporary art into the spotlight, focusing on a particular medium and theme. This year’s exhibition focuses primarily on crafts and design, showcasing living art in harmony with life itself.   A carnival of artworks born from the hands of nine participating artists blur and extend the borders of living art, transcending genre and medium. Crafts produced through handiwork such as kneading, weaving, processing, and applying paints to and with both traditional and modern materials like ceramics, hanji, steel, and plastic have a practical use while synesthetically carrying aspects of modeling beauty. Design works such as lighting fixtures and furniture that have been filtered into our living space help to enrich our lifestyles through a reinterpretation of traditional motifs in a contemporary fashion, experimenting with the fusion of materials. Living and craft items such as antique stoves and vintage items that an artist has collected reflect his preferences and inspire his work. At the exhibition viewers are able to go through an encounter between art and life where they will sense the delicate touch and eyes of the artists alongside the physical properties of diverse materials.  This exhibition is particularly meaningful in that it will showcase new pieces alongside remakes of the works exhibited at the Nam Seoul Living Arts Museum, an art museum founded in 2012 that has dedicated itself to crafts and design. The art show provides viewers of the Buk Seoul Museum of Art, a community-friendly public art complex, with an opportunity to experience art closely associated with life and will expand the original function of the museum through the transregional linkage of the Buk Seoul Museum and the Nam Seoul Living Arts Museum.  Through Festival of Hands which promises to offer a new aesthetic inspiration and thrill, we hope you will be able to fully enjoy living art in which function has been orchestrated with beauty.

They can install the artwork in one corner of the exhibition room and give it the title Posthumous Work.  10. None of the artists should feel bad or guilty about the others. However, if they do feel bad, they can talk to the manager.

As with most things in life, some collections may begin out of impulse. Still, things that are being repeated and are continuous tend to have their own unique reasons, generating an order or a system. When a collector collects things, he adds some meaning or value to them beyond the general and conventional value, characteristics, and meaning. As a result, he forms his unique scope of collection and the criteria for classification. The materials that are being collected and classified in such manner may turn into a visual map that can represent a collector’s thinking, assertion, and sensibility.   2 Homunculus is a Latin word meaning “little man.” In neuroanatomy, a visual representation of parts of the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for the processing of motor information, will take on the appearance of a homunculus with big head and big hands. The sensory homunculus depicts a big eye that covers the entire body, but this does not necessarily reflect the amount of cerebral cortex devoted to the eyes. It seems that the appearance of a little man with big eyes and giant hands can be likened to artists who observe trivial things attentively with great effort, collect things that mesmerize them, and continuously create things based on their observations.  This exhibition was planned out of personal curiosity. As an artist, when I see artworks by other artists, I am mostly curious about what has made them create art and what has driven them to continue doing it. I find clues to these questions from materials or data from which the creation of an artwork began. An impulse to embody something comes from such original data and materials. The moment is a moment of curiosity and a moment of purely aesthetic impulse. As if a person’s soul and another person’s spirit confront each other, a moment through which the mind of an artist and certain objects face off reflects a moment of potential when object A transforms into a totally different object B as in alchemy.   3 Artist KIM Eun Hyung attempts to reinterpret the music, actions, literature, stage art, and architecture - which are elements of a performance - in a modern way while appreciating an opera. He investigates several versions of the performance of one opera and collects various materials such as song books, interviews with stage designers, and drawings. Opera, which is a collective art (Gesamtkunstwerk), becomes richer and varied by using the medium of the artist, who is an appreciator of the performance. His drawing work, which includes the artist’s appreciation in the present time and space, and the content of opera encompass various interpretations of one performance from different perspectives. His sculptural drawings and wall drawing works give the impression of self-expansion as the images organically interconnect.  Artist NOH Sangho is a collector and a painter as well as a storyteller. He collects various photos of different uses from the Internet and draws on carbon paper by placing it on the collected photos. He discovers stories from his collections as if associating things with the stains on the walls or clouds.  His carbon paper drawings, reflecting his imagination, take on new images and stories that are totally different from those of the original. His drawings and stories resemble each other as they traverse each other. Several paintings are sometimes connected to form one story. The link connecting several photos from different sources is a mood that can be uniquely felt from his photos, and it is his own imagination that is expressed through the medium of photos.  Artist U Juju often visits the supermarkets and museums of various countries numerous times to work on <The Super Museum Project>. After the exploration and investigations, she creates folk works or artifacts that can be seen from the local museums by using the objects produced in the local area. Outcomes such as armor made of aluminum plates or dress made of paper napkin look like the most common materials and most typical objects, yet they are unusual, unfamiliar things. Based on the fact that the artifacts collected by museums also make things look different depending on the time and place and involve an external point of view, her artwork can be considered a parody about the museums.   Artist LEE Boram collects journalism photos on wars or terrors. The collected photos are classified into the theme of Christianity according to the criteria for similarity in images. When the classified photos are changed to a painting, the color, brightness, and victim-surrounding background of the original photos are removed. Consequently, the victims on the painting are detached from concrete incidents, becoming anonymous “victims” or victims who symbolize wars and tragedy or express them metaphorically. The process resembles a method wherein the image of the victims and the sensibility of viewers are consumed in the environment of today’s mass media.   Artist CHUNG Munkyung collects old clothes. Apparently, the reason she collects old clothes, not new ones, is that what she collects is not clothes as an object, but clothes as a reservoir of memories and recollections. As a result, the objects she makes out of clothes resemble childhood play. The play is not at all pleasant or trivial, however. She intentionally differentiates the inside and outside of clothes in her work. The clothes, which function like skin above the skin or serve as a protective barrier or a boundary between the “self” and the outside world, continuously remind viewers of the issues of individuals vs. groups.  Artist JU Sekyun’s <Tracing Drawing Series> begins from photos of museum porcelain collected from the Internet. Based on the collected photos, the artist makes ceramics and draws patterns on the ceramics with a pencil. Due to errors produced in the process of changing 3-D objects to 2-D images, the artist has to go through the process of “selection” and “concession.” Through such rearrangement, new ceramics that are totally different from the actual ceramics or from those in photos are created. The process symbolizes regulations and customs accumulated within a community as well as the resulting life and anxiety. The discrepancy between a fixated social condition and the actual life resembles the white negative space of porcelain created in the process of rearrangement. Note, however, that the negative space is a positive space that connotes different possibilities.    4 The general value of materials is replaced with the meanings provided by collectors, artists, and homunculi, and they are filled with imaginations. Actually, the collections are like a mirror, reflecting the collectors’ interest and fascination(LEE Boram).

403,283,Accidental Encounter,,Buk Seoul Museum of Art,2015-06-12,2015-08-16,,,,,,,,,,"The Buk Seoul Museum of Art presents Accidental Encounter, an exhibition displaying works made up of the quotidian materials we come across in daily life. As the title referring to an “unexpected meeting” suggests, the art show exhibits artistic products that transcend our imagination, lending new value to a variety of everyday things such as mass-produced household items, fashion accessories, disposable products, abandoned goods, food, and natural objects.   Mundane trifling things chosen or found by the twenty-three artists attending the exhibition enter the realm of art, becoming ingredients for their work exploring personal experience, memories, conceptual and philosophical thinking, and whimsical imagination, while also experimenting with the material itself. This exhibition consisting of two parts, When material turns to content and When material turns to medium, has been designed to examine how familiar, abandoned or at times insignificant objects exist as works of art, gaining new aesthetic value.   On exhibit in the section When material turns to content on the first floor are mainly large-scale installations using materials whose substantial qualities as familiar objects are maintained. The intrinsic attributes and values of things, such as traces of time and memories accumulated in the objects and the way they are consumed in society, motivate these works. The materials are used as a formative language to hold the artists’ intent. They play around the boundaries between art and non-art, art and everyday life, being transformed into innovative works of art through diverse methods of integration, deconstruction, combination, modification, and presentation.   On display in the section When material turns to medium on the second floor are works whose appearances seem familiar to us like paintings, sculptures, or crafts. The materials used for these pieces are not immediately recognized, creating confusion in our perception. We are only able to grasp their true nature in the process of appreciating them leisurely with time. An exploration of their material properties culminates in these works. Materials found in accumulations of small units such as sequins, beads, grains, plastic blocks, and hair are used as mediums to generate spectacular optical illusions or create new forms through labor-intensive manual work.  This exhibition is intended to help stimulate interest in and an understanding of contemporary art and its use of materials, serving as an opportunity to encourage communication between the audience and the museum. It is also hoped the art show will offer a chance to experience a visual wonder through encounters with everyday objects that have fortuitously been turned into whimsical artworks and have become a part of contemporary art that we can intimately enjoy.

Kim Chong Hak is one of the most important artists of the Korean art world. For many years, he has been collecting traditional Korean wooden furniture, stone figures, agricultural tools, and folk craft. The collection is imbued with his extraordinary artistic vision and deserves attention for both its formal value and modern aesthetics that is uniquely his own, as well as for its manifestation of a living craft constructed by everyday people.  To Kim Chong Hak, in addition to being a playful act collecting is an important vehicle in the expansion of his artistic vision. His collection is significant in that it becomes a key to his creation that reverberates in his oeuvre. Especially, allowing it to develop into his own works, the artist has found a contemporary sensibility in the proportion and color of the crafts constructed freely and used by everyday people.   Kim Chong Hak Collection, A Key to Creation features the artist’s works and various collections to be appreciated together. Rather than its significance as an antique object, each collection is presented in a way that effectively conveys the formal values that the artist has observed.

835218,279,2015 NANJI ART SHOW II : Nightseeing,,SeMA Nanji Residency,2015-05-28,2015-06-07,http://semananji.seoul.go.kr/english/program/exhibition_list.jsp ,,,2pm-6pm (closed on mondays),,"installation, video, painting ",4,"Woosung Lee, Yi Yunyi, Jang Minseung, Jaiyoung Cho ",,"Nightseeing  The horizon was completely right round. Beneath the broad cupola of the sky the enormous disc of the barren sea extended all around; but in that empty, measureless space our sense of time also suffers, and we daze in the disorienting shapelessness. Death in Venice (1912) by Thomas Mann  You must have gone to see the night sea on impulse at least once. Humans' unconscious desire to see the sea reflects a cathartic need. Similar to the introductory part of Thomas Mann's novel 「Death in Venice」, which is cited above, this exhibition begins from an attempt to draw in a melting point and to experience a personal, social feeling as one stares at plane scenery resembling an abstract color painting depicting the sky and the sea.   The Nanji Exhibition Halls are dome-shaped galleries; they used to be water-recycling tanks. As described in 「Death in Venice」, the dome-shaped gallery is a space that can create borderless scenery wherein a huge horizon crosses between the sky and sea, assuming we are standing on the sea. It is because the circular space is surrounded by the same scenery in all directions. This multi-sensory situation evokes a multidimensional utopian fantasy that transcends the concept of “time” and “space” by suggesting two-dimensional flat scenes in a multisensory approach. The exhibition <Nightseeing> is an attempt at an interactive project that promotes communications between others and me and connects between spaces.   Yi Yunyi “OI,” which consists of a two-channel video installation, is a landmark of Yeosu built to commemorate the “International Exposition Yeosu Korea 2012.” “Big-O” is a new media show that provides educational contents on the protection of the marine ecosystem and future of humanity in the form of splendid videos and sound effect by using water screen, watershed, fog, flame, laser, and lighting. The Sky Tower facing the “Big-O” is an architectural structure built in the shape of a harp with the function of a pipe organ that produces the largest boat horn sound by reusing a deserted cement warehouse. Yi Yunyi sees the night sea's maximized lyricism from the disharmony and man-made beauty of the two structures, which present contrasting time, media, and formation.   Jaeyoung Cho The heavy silence of the night sea is in contrast to the space of daytime, which reveals everything vividly. It may disrupt serenity or silence depending on the circumstances but is attributable to the fear, confusion, or terror hidden beneath. The feeling that can be had from the first encounter will soon change to anxiety and discomfort. What is the root cause of the anxiety felt from the night sea? Does our vague fear about deeply hidden identity, which can be sensed but not confirmed, make us anxious? Is it due to the cold mask of the night sea, which acts calmly, silently, and peacefully even if it is holding something that may destroy me?   The incidents we have experienced recently may be the deeply hidden side of the night sea. The numerous tragedies submerged into the deep sea and the stillness above the sea weighed down<?> with water and darkness -- the discrepancy between the two is as unrealistic as the bleak night sea. Nonetheless, the irony of such discrepancy, which is much more unrealistic, is our reality that is silently dormant in the midst of dark, cold peace presented by the night sea. Even though unrealistic things that cannot be understood are continuously making other unrealistic things, nothing happens today and in our daily life.  Woosung Lee During this exhibition, artist Woosung Lee draws the night sea on the wall of the Nanji dome-shaped exhibition gallery. For this work, he revisited Byeonsanbando National Park where he used to play with his friends. The park used to serve as a background of the artwork <At the Nightseeing> created in 2010.  In terms of time and space, there is discrepancy between the sea in the framework of memory and the re-visited sea as well as the sea presented at the Nanji Circular Exhibition Hall. Likewise, time is not a simple order of Incidents if we look at them from the perspective of relativity. The order of incidents between static people and moving people changes. In other words, time flows differently. When referring to the order of Incidents and time, time become meaningless if we do not designate who observes the incidents.

","The horizon was completely right round. Beneath the broad cupola of the sky the enormous disc of the barren sea extended all around; but in that empty, measureless space our sense of time also suffers, and we daze in the disorienting shapelessness. Death in Venice (1912) by Thomas Mann  You must have gone to see the night sea on impulse at least once. Humans' unconscious desire to see the sea reflects a cathartic need. Similar to the introductory part of Thomas Mann's novel 「Death in Venice」, which is cited above, this exhibition begins from an attempt to draw in a melting point and to experience a personal, social feeling as one stares at plane scenery resembling an abstract color painting depicting the sky and the sea.   The Nanji Exhibition Halls are dome-shaped galleries; they used to be water-recycling tanks. As described in 「Death in Venice」, the dome-shaped gallery is a space that can create borderless scenery wherein a huge horizon crosses between the sky and sea, assuming we are standing on the sea. It is because the circular space is surrounded by the same scenery in all directions. This multi-sensory situation evokes a multidimensional utopian fantasy that transcends the concept of “time” and “space” by suggesting two-dimensional flat scenes in a multisensory approach. The exhibition <Nightseeing> is an attempt at an interactive project that promotes communications between others and me and connects between spaces(Yeojoo Park).

The prints by Korean artists from 1980?90 are selected from the collection of SeMA, displaying generational participatory arts of Korean artists following the previous K?the Kollwitz print exhibition.   This exhibition traces the artistic movement reflecting the spirits of Korean artists of the time, and contemplates art as not being separate from life, which was a new communication method of that time.   The photo gallery 1 exhibits prints published from early to mid?1980s, by Oh Yoon (1946?1986), Min Joung-ki (1949?), and Hong Sung Dam (1955?). Those prints reflects historical affairs such as the Korean War (6?25 War), and the reality of a military dictatorship, as well as the 5?18 Gwangju Democratic Uprising that was directly experienced by the artists when they were young intellectuals.   Photo gallery 2 displays prints published from the mid?1980s to early 1990s, and by Kim, Joon?Kwon (1956?), whose works address peasant movement leaders, Park Bul Dong (1956?) whose works satirized the political and social reality of that time, and Seon Wung, Hong (1952?) whose works reflect his hope for reunification and democratization of Korea.   The new art movement led by the artists mentioned above significantly contributed to the establishment of today’s Korean contemporary art scene. When reflecting on the print art of the 80s?90s, the significance of those artists is apparent, particularly with regard to how they acknowledged and reflected reality into their works, which was a first in Korean art; they elevated the topic and content addressed by their works; and they thereby helped Korean contemporary art obtain its identity.   The SeMA prints collection exhibition will review the interests of artists and the spirit of the time while comparing them with the worldwide art movement of participatory realism.

395,277,2015 SeMA Green : YUN SUKNAM ♥ HEART,,Seoul Museum of Art,2015-04-21,2015-06-28,,,,,Free,"Painting, Sculpture, Drawing, Installation Work",,Yun Suknam,,"Seoul Museum of Art has been hosting ‘SeMA Tricolor Exhibition’ in every other year to highlight the works of Korean artists in different generations. While the exhibitions on blue of emerging artists and gold of artists in mid-career run as group exhibitions, green of highly esteemed artists run as a solo exhibition for invited artists. The artist of the second edition of ‘SeMA Green’ is Yun Suknam.  Yun Suknam is the leading artist in women’s art and the pioneer of feminist art in Korea. She touches on various issues such as maternity, femininity, history of women, and ecology and in which constructs such topics with the lens of healing and loving on others while visualizes such topics with her unique plastic language.   《2015 SeMA Green : Yun Suknam ♥ the Heart》, as the title of this exhibition suggests, a heart may serve as a metaphor to summarize Yun Suknam’s art world. Heart signifies the creative passion of the artist, love and solicitude for all women, and the mother. Yun Suknam has been showing undiminishing enthusiasm for creativity ever since age of 40 when she was able to set up an art studio of her own and pledged a new life as an artist. The very first drawing she made was her mother, and the works from late 1980s, as a leading artist of feminism in the realm of Minjoong Art(People’s art movement in the 1980s), were mostly about the reminiscences of her mother, the reflection on the reality of women that is levied on the patriarchal society, and the dedication to forgotten women artists in the history.  This exhibition constitutes about 50 pieces of Yun Suknam’s work over past thirty years, the early works from 1980s to a new work from this year, into four topics ? mother, nature, history of women, and narrativity ? in order to highlight the oeuvres of the artist in depth. As heart represents, which is the title of the exhibition and the new work, this exhibition will be the invaluable opportunity to understand the passion and altruistic life of the artist and to explore the traces of all her works.

Starting from two We have not been with the beginning of “art.” Art had already begun on the foundation of art history, artists, and society. Art, which has begun in a shape determined by others, cannot be free. In any case, even when artists construct their own art world regardless of previous art, they would not be truly free since they are to be evaluated within the “art.” With the advent of contemporary art, artists succeed art activities in search of a new frame by expressing their creativity and originality within the frame of various discourses, techniques, meanings, and social backgrounds. They are then evaluated, and the evaluations are relative. Absolute evaluations are sometimes expected in art, but reality does not work that way. The standard for value changes, and it is relative. How is the standard determined? In contemporary art, the standard seems to become more obscure.  3. Shape of ginger The shape of ginger is not defined. To the question 'What does ginger look like?' no definite image comes to mind. However, the function and use of ginger are clear, and gingers take on various shapes. The topography of art cannot be drawn easily at first thought, so it is postulated in the shape of a ginger. Likewise, it metaphorizes that art clearly exists, yet the shape of art is obscure. Exhibitions have been planned from outside SeMA　Nanji Residency. Each year, several artists apply, and residency artists are determined according to a certain standard. Selected artists come to think that their art world is 'recognized,' with the unselected artists starting to ask what kind of standard was used.   4. No use career The profile of artists is evaluated. A list of art activities, such as solo exhibitions, group exhibitions, contests participated in, collection of artwork, awards, and residency, is specified. The content is also a kind of 'recognized' record by somebody. Then, let us review 'undisclosed' art activities. Failed art activities……. The art world of an artist may be recognized at an event, but not at other events. This, of course, can be attributed to the fact that elements such as the preference of a contest host or social background may have been influenced by or attributed to the artist's prior art activities in terms of quality and quantity. That alone cannot suffice as explanation, however.  Dissimilar results of the same portfolio, which is applied to different contests during the same period, may not be enough to say that a failed record is a result in contrast to a successful record. In other words, success and failure are not in opposite directions; rather, they are simply determined by a criterion. Artists who see this exhibition from the perspective of viewers may be able to get temporary solace from the failed artists who became the subjects of this exhibition. Nonetheless, solace cannot be a solution. 1. Once again, one Our common beginning would be art for college entrance. How much would the art techniques acquired for college entrance differ from contemporary art? Artists attempt to investigate the relationship between their early art and contemporary art. Artists who participated in an art test drew or made a ginger sculpture, which symbolizes contemporary art, in a college art method with which each artist began. Is there any relationship between their college art skill and their present ability as an artist? Is there an interrelation between their early art and their present art activities and expressions? We start to think how the evaluation criterion applied to an artist has changed over the period from college entrance art to contemporary art, what the criterion is, and whether the criterion has been simply changing like fashion.   5. National and public museums of art Even though we do not know who operates art, art probably begins from artists. Museums of art and cultural foundations can exist when artists exist. However, the situation has been reversed: in contemporary art ? artists can exist when museums of art exist. Within contemporary art, artists must be recognized for their artistic ability, and they can survive when the public and national museums of art buy their artworks and provide workplace and exhibition funds. Korean contemporary artists cannot survive easily without national and public museums of art. The evaluation criterion seems to become obscure, yet every aspect of artists is under evaluation.   6. Coward metaphor  Exhibitions are basically for 'artists.' Artists participating in exhibitions have come to participate in exhibitions in a way that is totally different from their art world. The exhibitions are intended not to allow artists to draw the shape of art in their own way, but to present the shape of art that has been drawn, regardless of their intention. Artists try to 'consume' exhibitions that have been planned with the assistance of national and public museums of art, rather than as 'producers' of art with assistance from national and public museums of art. The exhibitions will offer a party for artists to enjoy on the opening day; they are also concrete and explanatory. Contrary to the present situation of the contemporary, which leaves open the possibility of interpretation, the exhibitions suggest tests in a concrete way and in an imposing style. Even if this may seem a coward metaphor, interpreting obscurity will take a long time. The intent of exhibition planning will suffice by simply acknowledging the fact that the standard of evaluations is obscure, and that nobody actually knows what the standard is like(Park Cheonwook). <br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>opening reception: 2015. 4.17.

The exhibition displays the collections gathered by three artists Kim Hee Soo, Lee Ju Yong , and Huh Myoung Wook over an extended period of time.   The artist Kim Hee Soo presents a collection of audio products from the 1950s and 60s gathered with an idea of historical context of design. The artist Lee Ju Yong presents a collection of antique cameras and old photographs with a particular interest in memory and documenting. The artist Huh Myoung Wook presents a collection of vintage furniture and dinnerware from various periods along with his own vintage-style works.  Three artists’ different types of collections such as antique cameras, antique audio, and vintage furniture should be considered as a creative reference  that influences the artists indirectly more than the narcissistic objects that reflect the each artist’s taste. Moreover, the exhibition can be meaningful in that aesthetic sympathy expands cultural historical implications when their collections are displayed in a public museum beyond the private realms.   Through the exhibition that demonstrates how the artist’s collecting is related to creating as well as the modern and contemporary lifestyles and tastes, it intensifies the role of Nam Seoul Museum as a ‘living arts museum.’ Also, audience will have a new experience by discovering the act of collecting that can be a creative process.

This exhibition, co-organized by SeMA and the Korea Foundation, is presented in relation to the Asia Colloquium: The Subtle Triangle, which was held at SeMA in November 2014. Following academic discussions among directors and curators of private/public museums in East Asia as well as practitioners who work actively in the international art field, the exhibition focuses on the artists; Yangachi (Korea), Xu Zhen (China), and Koizumi Meiro (Japan). The Subtle Triangle attempts to escape Western-oriented analyses of Northeast Asia as well as nationalism, regionalism, and culturalism, focusing rather on the art world of the artists who are leading the upcoming generation. This exhibition will further examine the current state of Northeast Asia and thus propose change and development.   Yangachi, Xu Zhen, and Koizumi Meiro were all born in the 1970s. They not only lead the Asian art world, but also actively participate in international exhibitions and art events. Yangachi presents his new production Sea Salt Theatre for the current exhibition. Sea Salt Theatre is an experiment within his recent interest in researching geographical elements and temporalities that are based within Asia. Yangachi aspires to greet and re-appropriate new audiences through his work. Koizumi Meiro from Japan is presenting a series of works that explores moments of human emotion and control. For The Subtle Triangle, he reveals how the disappearance of historical facts are witnessed and reestablished, thus presenting a critical perspective of distinct historical circumstances of Japan. Xu Zhen from China founded the MadeIn Company in 2009, and has continuously presented works that question the limits and meaning of art. Xu has recently been invited to exhibit at diverse international museums as well as Art Basel Miami and the Biennale de Lyon. Xu and Koizumi both present their large-scale works for the first time in Korea.   The Subtle Triangle also provides an archive lounge on the third floor, which presents a history of cultural exchanges among Korea, China, and Japan since 1989 (when Korea and China initiated cultural exchange). The archive offers an opportunity to examine the sensitive and interesting sociopolitical history of the three countries alongside its art history. Additionally, an education program co-organized by the education department of SeMA and the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat will invite youth from Northeast Asia who live in Seoul to discuss and share ideas on the past, present, and future of the three countries based on the exhibition and historical records, and further share their opinions on the potential paths the countries should take. Instead of observing one another with a contemplative attitude, The Subtle Triangle strives to construct a new discourse on Northeast Asian contemporary art by materializing their topics and enthusiastically engaging one another through psychological expansion.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192847_e10ca8ba8dab4a33b9059cf892a1762a_54ce02a5405d495db9b82501605ca48a,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=386,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

389,271,Unfolding the Folds of Elephant,,Buk Seoul Museum of Art Exhibition Hall 1,2015-03-05,2015-05-10,,,,,,,,,,"What is Seeing ? Elephant  “What is seeing?”  Can an experience of touch, smell, sound, or taste replace the idea of “seeing?”  What kind of relationships do seeing, feeling, and understanding the nature of a phenomenon and object form?  The exhibition Unfolding the Folds of Elephant explores the original and fundamental subject of “What is seeing.” This exhibition begins where different approaches and perspectives of the artist Oum Jeongsoon and the visually impaired meet about the same question they were asked. Oum works on the subject of the formation and destruction of infinite lines, “the nature of presence” through its repetitive action, and on the ideological essence of “seeing.” On the other hand, works of art by the blind are produced by seeing through the heart as they physically trace things to visualize an idea - it is their ability to discern the whole from the part as they approach the nature of presence and the essence of seeing what is not seen through another kind of vision. These are the reasons that Elephant  WALK  by Oum and Touching An Elephant by the visually impaired are exhibited in the same space.  Nothing but the presence of an elephant has made this entire journey possible. As the artist Oum and the blind manifest the nature of seeing, they seek the nature of existence and there is an elephant in the center.  Through the life of an individual elephant, Through the historical event where an elephant plays an important role We look into the dynamic soul of a great species, an elephant, And we gain a deep insight into ourselves   Similar to what the ecology psychologist Dr. Bradshaw once mentioned, in the encounter with heavy steps that reminds us of an agony, its enormous frame, long nose, spherical back, and the many folds of an elephant, this exhibition invites us to the origin. While Oum is concerned with the fundamental matter of “seeing” she not only focuses on a broadening epistemological prospect but also how to broaden our lives through this exhibition.  Messages from elephants living with us - its original form passed on from ancient times - aren't visible in its hidden layers and folds (of numerous times and spaces). These folds are stretched open by the eye of the artist, the blind, the elephant, and the audience.

It showcases a total 56 works, covering her early and later years, all of which belong to the Sakima Art Museum in Okinawa, Japan. The exhibition is jointly held by the Center for Peace Museum.  The artworks on exhibition can be largely divided into before and after World War I in 1914. The Photo Gallery 1 presents the artworks that Kollwitz had produced after World War I. During this period, the artist captured historical incidents that occurred throughout World War I and personal experiences, such as the death of her son who died in action. The Photo Gallery 2 displays Kollwitz's early representative works before World War I, including major series of artworks and portraits of female workers. The artworks express the conflicts between different socio-economic classes in the midst of Germany's rapid industrialization and the social problems that ensued.  The portrait of the artist, who participated in relief activities with her doctor husband in poor villages and who formed her social consciousness while experiencing the war and hardships of the time, reveals elements that are both autobiographical and historical. Her artworks consistently portrayed social irrationality, which posed a threat to humanity, as well as her desperate, yet resolute resistance against wars.   We hope viewers will have the opportunity to glimpse into the social, artistic, and personal elements of Kollwitz's artwork through this exhibition.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192847_ceaf8b81db8e48a397d3b3a6b803f24f_56d8da5b8fe043fc8f5ed3638a976052,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=385,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

My work was triggered by observational drawings recorded at specific points during cycling trips in and around the South Korean capital. Brick is a photograph of an enlarged ephemeral structure also entitled Brick. Initially the work took the form of an object that was placed under Seogang bridge as an art intervention. This form was modelled on a sixteen-sided standard brick. The original brick is produced at multiple locations including the Mapo Recovery Facility. This hexadecagonal form is used by anglers, at outdoor exercise parks, in general construction, and can also be seen at arbitrary locations across the city. Eunbong is a bi-chromatic painting, which was developed from sketches and a small black and white paper collage. The geometric painting is composed in juxtapositions of several layers of black and white oil paint. It portrays an unfinished highway. Finally, Shin is a work sourced from the Jjimjilbang public bath symbol and has been merged with the Hebrew letter Shin. Shin is the first letter of the name of G-d and is the central motif on the Mezuzah, commonly seen on the doorpost of a Jewish home. In these works I have manipulated forms of the urban landscape to investigate the different ways in which objects and places are perceived. The works attempt to emblemise their subject and to offer an alternative way of looking at the infrastructure of the city.  The 4th season International Artists decided to call the exhibition NANJI TANKS after the exhibition hall in which their exhibition will take place.

Holidays,  10:00-18:00 / Mondays Closed",,Public Service Advertising,70,,,"The SeMA Buk Seoul Museum of Art presents 2014 Seoul Focus - PSA is the Message.  Celebrating its twenty-ninth year, “Seoul Focus” departed from SeMA’s annual exhibition “Seoul Arts Festival” since 2012, concentrating on diverse issues related to a specific theme under its new title. On the heels of last year’s subject of contemporary Korean painting, the current exhibition has selected “Public Service Advertising” as this year’s theme. The exhibition highlights the values of an era by introducing domestic and foreign public service advertisements that cover a variety of themes and epochs.   If advertisements are a “mirror reflecting society,” public service advertisements are “activities that improve the society reflected in the mirror.” Public service advertisements influence the public’s positive actions by proposing ideas, attitudes, and practices that reflect a public character and acutely discern social problems of the period. The current exhibition focuses on these values of the period by presenting around seventy pieces of public service advertisements that embrace a diverse range of epochs and themes.   The exhibition comprises a diachronic section reflecting the history of Korea, and a synchronic section that deals with global issues. With an attempt to show public concerns during the development of society and how advertisements reflected those concerns, part 1 presents public service advertisements produced in Korea from the 1960s to the present. Part 2 introduces domestic and foreign public service advertisements that talk about global issues, including the protection of the environment and wildlife, and defending human rights. Messages of “sharing” and “caring” that  many countries deliver, which concern universal problems in contemporary society, no longer remain subjects dealt with only by photography or video, but expand to diverse and integrated forms of media.    Public service advertisements question and suggest what a promising future should look like, by revealing our social, cultural, and environmental problems. These advertisements strive to realize the value of coexistence and symbiosis. I hope this exhibition, which attends once again to the voice of the public that may go unnoticed due to its omnipresence, operates as a turning point for contemplating the values of making a better society. Furthermore, I hope the exhibition becomes a place for communication where viewers can share innovative ideas, an abundance of creativity, and original thoughts alongside the theme of public service advertisements.  ※The title of the exhibition, PSA is the Message is inspired by a phrase from Marshall McLuhan, “The medium is the message.” ",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192848_bfabcc59e6d045d784f4611f6035292a_66ad0d3d04004e51940de314bf18722e,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=381,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Being the first in Korea to introduce contemporary African art, it also sets out to represent post-colonial, diaspora, and non-Western art by presenting the current states of African art.   The exhibition presents a wide array of artists, from those who struggle with their minority identities as African immigrants residing in Europe or North America, such as Yinka Shonibare and Chris Ofili, to those who address epics on nationalism or religious conflicts in post-colonial Africa, such as Goncalo Mabunda and Rachid Koraichi.   The exhibition aims to examine the basis of post-colonialism, and also contemplate on the meaning of African diaspora art, which can be traced back to Western colonialism and slavery. This would allow us to explore the critical viewpoints on Western-centrism and the racial and multicultural issues that occur on a global level. Ultimately, considering Korea’s situation in which multiculturalism has become an issue of increasing seriousness, the exhibition will provide an opportunity to assess the social awareness and attitude toward a multicultural setting.

A collection of frames constitutes a shot, and then a sequence that acquires meaning. Rectangular units of meaning are projected on to a white flat screen. Most of the time, the ‘screen-audience-projector’ paradigm set in order. In a theater, the audience sits comfortably in soft seats, though that may vary in some degree, all facing toward to gaze at the silver screen. The word ‘screen’ connotes ‘protection’ or ‘partition’, The physical environment of a theater encourages the audience to metaphorically separate their minds from their bodies and absorb the world unfolded on the screen through the audiovisual senses only. The screen is perfect and solid in itself as if no external space exists, like a window on the wall of shut-off space. The audience experiences virtual life and sense of time, a window onto a world unto itself.   Moving image has rapidly broken away from the physical medium that is film, and has embodied in more varied properties owing to the development of digital technology. This means we perceive cinema in various forms that were unimaginable before. The firm belief of the single screen has become softer over the last couple decades as it is interacts with para-cinematic media practices, such as video art, installation and performance. As mentioned earlier, the screen contains the meaning of protection and partition. However, we should be reminded that the screen is actually a semi-transparent shield. The screen hides and holds the audience in a simulacrum, but it is open toward different worlds that mirror each other. The screen is fixed and settled, yet fluid and flexible. It also connects while also separating the world of image and the world of the audience. It is like a variable gate and square, which can be opened or closed. Accordingly, the frames overlapping on the screen are not only perceived in a fixed environment in disposition of ‘screen-audience-projector’, but also able to exist in reflection of all imaginable forms. A soft screen can be folded, bended, overlapping and torn if necessary. Moreover it can also be transformed into anything that reflects. It can even be intangible images to someone who experience it without the form of a regular screen. In ‘Soft Screen : Montage of Dispositif’, the so-called screen can be attached to a wall in conventional way, and also be located space between; it can be put on the floor or ceiling, it can be placed inside or outside an exhibition hall.    Throughout the discussion for the show, the participating artists have come to the realization that each is an ‘apparatus’ and lights up multiple screens of the exhibition space. The artists hope this montage of screens to become a unique one in a specific space and time at the spot where they coincide with audience to go beyond something that have been already filmed, made or completed, even if the practices being attempted on the ‘Soft Screen’ are not completely new. Visitors of this exhibition will be able to walk through the montage of the screens, which are involved with each other as they individually exist in the exhibition space. The artist hope that visitors will become wandering editors in circular spaces while they experience some work of art that are loosely arranged, and project themselves on to the soft screens to compose their own frames from what they have experienced.■ Jeon Hayoung",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192846_31d4bb3398a040079befb8ceec3158fa_90f3c2b4d71e46bb90b07a79e9f4e9cf,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=373,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Such a social change has led to the disintegration of ‘the family’ and ‘the community’ as we used to understand them. However, new patterns of life and new concepts in space occupancy are being gradually disseminated throughout society. It is believed that this phenomenon attests to the fact that our society requires the emergence of a new type of family, a loose tie among community members, and a new concept community.   CO-LIVING SCENARIOS raises the questions and suggests solutions for the dwelling culture and associated phenomena of our time with 9 invited architects/teams. We hope that this project, with the aid of the great architectural imagination of our panel of architects, will serve as an invaluable opportunity to discuss such issues as ‘the values of co-living’ and ‘the self-reliance of communities’ in an urban environment where the concepts of sharing and community are losing their persuasive power.

This exhibition starts with questions such as 'What do low technologies mean in the era where high technologies are rampant?' 'Why are young artists interested in low technologies?' and 'How do technologies change art?'  Art has been changing alongside the advancement of technologies. Painting techniques have been developed with the advancement of paint and pigment technologies; photos and movies born from the age of mechanical reproduction have changed the direction of art into exploring art as a medium itself, with the development of digital technologies ? which become dematerialized and digitized into  0 and 1 ? placed under a totally new condition called 'the transformation of data based on data and algorithm.' Of course, such many branches of changing patterns cannot be simplified easily, and the change of art would simply be driven by the elements of technology. Nonetheless, we cannot deny the fact that technologies serve as an important factor in forming the background and condition in the flow of all changes of art itself.  In Korea, which is one of the world's leading IT countries and where there are many early technology adopters, young artists would naturally be sensitive to such technological changes and art/social environment driving such changes. What is important in the reality where art and technologies interfere with and cross over each other is returning to the backbone of technology ? whether it is good or bad ? and thinking about the technology, as what Martin Heidegger, who hoped for the possibility of artistic technology rather than a simple tool asserted, i.e., technologies should return to techn?. According to Heidegger, the concept of ancient Greek's techn? carried the meaning of handwork technology and the meaning of high-dimensional art (Poiesis) as well as the power of disclosure. This exhibition attempts to look into Heidegger's philosophy about technology through artworks by 10 young artists, such as Kim Tae Eun, Park Ki Jin, Shin Sung Hwan, Yang Jung Uk, Lee Bei kyoung, Lee Byung Chan, Ye Seong Lee, Woonwoo Lee, Jung Sung Yoon, Jung Ji Hyun, as well as artworks by Yook Eae-jin, Moon Joo, Hong Sung Do.  The 10 artists who participate in this exhibition will present artworks reflecting their thoughts about technologies visually and intelligently: artists Jung Ji Hyun and Yang Jung Uk change the function of technology while concentrating on the mechanical mechanism itself by connecting it with our daily life; artists Kim Tae Eun and Park Ki Jin pose questions about the boundary between one's own reality and virtuality by basing on narratives; artists Shin Sung Hwan and Woonwoo Lee create a dreamy, humorous space by using simple technology; artists Lee Bei kyoung and Lee Byung Chan express the fragments of a metropolitan life metaphorically through technology, and; artists Jung Sung Yoon and Ye Seong Lee make viewers think about a medium itself through mechanical devices completed by visitors' participation. Artworks by artists Yook Eae-jin, Moon Joo, and Hong Sung Do, who have been exploring the techniques and meaning of low technologies within the topology of the Korean art arena during the period 1980s?1990s, will also be presented at this exhibition to enrich communications between the two generations.  This exhibition will provide a good opportunity for visitors to participate in some artworks by personally operating them at the exhibition hall and to take part in artists' creation processes, such as formation, patterning, inference, modeling, play, transformation, and integration, particularly since this exhibition is held during the winter vacation. Low technology and high technology ? old and new media ? form a new relationship through the contradictions and conflicts of each. They become contents and forms for each other, endlessly reorganizing the present and the relationship between old and new. Let us now reflect on the meaning and direction of this era's technology and art by looking into the aesthetics of low technology.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_57e5075947ad48728b11187a72c34927_8c5e446a9d9d49beb071b973e09991e9,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=379,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Long ago, the human race came up with many stories about the unknown world of the moon, which has always shown the Earth only its face. We wished wishes to the moon and regarded it as a mysterious, godly being. People imagined what the other, unseen side of the moon might look like, and the moon came to be recognized as something more than ‘a satellite closest to the Earth’ in our unconsciousness. The unseen rear face of the moon, which eventually came to be revealed thanks to the power of science, was full of scars and traces, unlike its smooth front side.   This exhibition, titled The World of behind the Moon, will provide visitors with an opportunity to peek into the artists’ sincere, honest side through their work, which has not be seen in exhibition rooms previously. Artists are not familiar with showing themselves off, but in this exhibition they reveal their very private hobbies and their ‘hinterland’ through interviews. The exhibition was planned with the intention of displaying parts of the artists’ personal, private lives, which may or may not resemble their works.                                                            The artists’ video will be shown in Exhibition Hall A, in which they will answer the question: ‘What do you need to discard when leaving the land that had already left behind?' Twenty-one Korean artists and three foreign artists who gathered at the SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY after their respective struggles talk honestly about ‘what to leave behind’ as they leave Nanji through a free-format interview that differs from the normal interview format.    Exhibition Hall B begins with the question ‘What do the artists do except when they work on their work?’ and approaches the artists’ inner world though a part of their lives, their hobbies. From the perspective of spectators who live outside the realm of art, ‘artists’ are eccentric beings who live within a not so average mind. Spectators are full of curiosity and questions, and these questions range beyond the works displayed in the exhibition halls to questions about the artists. And a part of the artists’ private lives, their hobbies, are displayed to show their humane side rather than their artistic traits, so this exhibition is more than a display of how the artists relieve their stress and spend their leisure time; rather, it shows the artists’ rawness instead of their complete works.   The last NANJI ART SHOW of the 8th group of artists of the SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY and Open Studio together created an opportunity for people to take a peek into their everyday lives rather than their work.   ■LEE Jiyen, ZIN Kijong<br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>opening reception: 11. 21.

Jiseung craft refers to the construction of objects by weaving rolled hanji paper cords. Traditionally used in everyday life, jiseung craft is becoming a forgotten discipline - even its name is unfamiliar to us. Jiseung craft is highly valuable because it possesses a plain and natural beauty that radiates from its unique texture. It is also a household item containing the traces of life.  Having studied textile art in college the artist has taken jiseung as her central theme. While focusing on modernizing the craft she pursues elements that are the most Korean. The artist reinterprets the traditional beauty of jiseung through her own perspective, expanding it as a contemporary object and developing its aesthetic dimension. This exhibition introduces numerous bodies from Lee ranging from her early works that explore traditional paper craft, her jiseung work, and the interior objects she newly constructs.   This exhibition is largely divided into two groups: one that interprets traditional themes and techniques in a contemporary fashion, and another, interior objects produced from the coiling jiseung technique. This exhibition also includes handmade hanji made out of leftover hanji paper from the jiseung crafting process, the artist’s archive, and video documentation that shows the process of  jiseung craft along with an interview for further understanding of the artist’s world.

Byun has focused on the universality of life exposed through photography. Here he presents portraits that capture the particularity of people hidden behind their ordinariness. This work was produced through photographs of the various people whom he encountered on the shooting set of the KBS National Song Contest.   For about 30 years, starting from its first broadcast in 1980, KBS 1TV ‘National Song Contest’ is a long-lasting program loved by many people. The artist, for a long time has been working with the medium of the ‘portrait.’ He began the project ‘National Song Contest’ in 2005 and has been working on the pictures seriously for three years from 2012 to 2014.  The artist who states that an ‘individual’s identity is closely connected to one’s relation to the society’, exposes the desire the contestants face ? in the song contest - through the photographs. Furthermore, he tries to show the ‘bare face’ of different generations living in contemporary times.  ‘National Song Contest’ project is a psychological report on contemporary figures observed by the artist. The work deeply reflects the artist’s idea that ‘the packaged and the processed are not the standard of beauty, rather, the raw state can be the barometer reflecting the present times.’ Through facial expressions and the poses of people in the photograph, the artist draws the inner particularity of each person. Moreover, the work exposes the strange and unfamiliar feelings manifested in the unique and splendid look of people from each region.     In this exhibition that spans the photo gallery 1 and 2, the audience can discover the artist’s intention. Through archival materials and videos presented with the project ‘National Song Contest’ the artist attempts to capture the contestants’ psychological desire, beyond their gender and background. We hope the audience will have an opportunity to find new aspects of our interior psyche when encountering these unique individuals the artist has photographed in the field. This is a place where everybody can express their inner individuality from an equal plane, without limitations of age and gender.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192846_c48126b8e0594111b7c214646d2e8e4a_1944dcb536294bd39206c2f2f8ee992d,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=376,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

A collection of frames constitutes a shot, and then a sequence that acquires meaning. Rectangular units of meaning are projected on to a white flat screen. Most of the time, the ‘screen-audience-projector’ paradigm set in order. In a theater, the audience sits comfortably in soft seats, though that may vary in some degree, all facing toward to gaze at the silver screen. The word ‘screen’ connotes ‘protection’ or ‘partition’, The physical environment of a theater encourages the audience to metaphorically separate their minds from their bodies and absorb the world unfolded on the screen through the audiovisual senses only. The screen is perfect and solid in itself as if no external space exists, like a window on the wall of shut-off space. The audience experiences virtual life and sense of time, a window onto a world unto itself.  Moving image has rapidly broken away from the physical medium that is film, and has embodied in more varied properties owing to the development of digital technology. This means we perceive cinema in various forms that were unimaginable before. The firm belief of the single screen has become softer over the last couple decades as it is interacts with para-cinematic media practices, such as video art, installation and performance. As mentioned earlier, the screen contains the meaning of protection and partition. However, we should be reminded that the screen is actually a semi-transparent shield. The screen hides and holds the audience in a simulacrum, but it is open toward different worlds that mirror each other. The screen is fixed and settled, yet fluid and flexible. It also connects while also separating the world of image and the world of the audience. It is like a variable gate and square, which can be opened or closed. Accordingly, the frames overlapping on the screen are not only perceived in a fixed environment in disposition of ‘screen-audience-projector’, but also able to exist in reflection of all imaginable forms. A soft screen can be folded, bended, overlapping and torn if necessary. Moreover it can also be transformed into anything that reflects. It can even be intangible images to someone who experience it without the form of a regular screen. In ‘Soft Screen : Montage of Dispositif’, the so-called screen can be attached to a wall in conventional way, and also be located space between; it can be put on the floor or ceiling, it can be placed inside or outside an exhibition hall.   Throughout the discussion for the show, the participating artists have come to the realization that each is an ‘apparatus’ and lights up multiple screens of the exhibition space. The artists hope this montage of screens to become a unique one in a specific space and time at the spot where they coincide with audience to go beyond something that have been already filmed, made or completed, even if the practices being attempted on the ‘Soft Screen’ are not completely new. Visitors of this exhibition will be able to walk through the montage of the screens, which are involved with each other as they individually exist in the exhibition space. The artist hope that visitors will become wandering editors in circular spaces while they experience some work of art that are loosely arranged, and project themselves on to the soft screens to compose their own frames from what they have experienced.  ■ Jeon Hayoung<br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>opening reception: 5pm",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2F2016%2Fmgimg%2Fimg31%2Feng%2F&FILE_NM=pfile2016_1468478287364.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835220,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
372,254,Title Match eun yup kang  vs.  Ji Eun Kim,,Buk Seoul Museum of Art,2014-10-07,2014-11-23,,,,,,,,,,"Buk Seoul Museum of Art presents Title Match, an exhibition that brings together works of a senior artist and an up-and-coming artist under the same roof.  First chosen for this exhibition to be a representative annual art show are eun yup kang, a prominent artist leading the Korean sculpture scene and Ji Eun Kim drawing attention as one of the representative new generation artists.  The work of these two artists starts from where they are living. The work of eun yup kang, who resides in the village beneath the foot of Cheonggye Mountain, is a record of nature’s wonder her found in her everyday life while walking into the woods of the mountain with her 10 companion dogs. The work of Ji Eun Kim, who has lived and worked at many art residencies at home and abroad, is an outgrowth of her persistent observation and exploration of the places she has inhabited. In this exhibition based on the themes of kang’s A Walk with a Tree and Kim’s A Reflection on Urbanism respectively, their work reflecting their ways of and attitudes toward life, as different as their generation gap, is intriguingly contrasted.   kang’s works, comprised of photographs of the forest, prints and sculptures using wood from forest trees, are anchored in her complete comprehension of the “forest”. She documents nature’s wonder, having observed the creation and extinction of trees that spread their roots and branches with endurance and wisdom and adapt themselves to ever-changing environments. kang attains a perfect assimilation into objects and generates sublime beauty by embracing nature as it is.   Ji Eun Kim collects all information through research and survey and unveils the hidden import and structure of such information. In this exhibition, Kim displays her keen insight into the influence and issue of urbanism through scenes she observed in Seoul, Byeokje, Detroit and New York. Kim’s work seems to be a representation of a specific site, but each scene intensively showcases the hallmarks of each city, including its history, social system, and regulations. With this, she raises urban issues such as suburbanization and gentrification.  The exhibition brings forth artistic conversations between these two artists representing two distinctly different generations, allowing their works to confront each other and mingle in the same space.

The exhibition <The Relics of Old Seoul> focuses on the northern area of Seoul where Buk Seoul Museum is located. The show reexamines the image of old Seoul by revisiting forgotten lives within the landscapes that have disappeared in the process of the city’s modernization.  As a city development project, that parallels the history of Korean modernism, began in earnest since the 1960s, many areas of Seoul have repeatedly encountered changes. In the process of moving the base of life, mountain villages emerged in different areas of Seoul. As redevelopment projects were conducted in the 1970-80s, mountain villages began to be demolished and low-rise apartments were built in their place. Only 20 years later the areas are changing to super high-rise apartment complexes - the developments are still ongoing.    This exhibition consists of artworks that contain the places that still keep the image of life in the past in the urbanization process centering around the northern area of Seoul. The works contain the memories of the city including houses that have disappeared throughout the development process, and the images of life that is still maintained despite the changes. Through constructing archives related to 104 Village at Junggye-dong with photography, video,  installation and painting, the exhibition enables viewers to see the aspects of the transition of the city through more diverse and objective perspectives.   We expect the exhibition <The Relics of Old Seoul> to be an opportunity to construct a new vision in the nostalgia aroused by memories of lives in the past and the changing images of the city, while viewing the landscape that has already disappeared, still disappearing in the present, and will soon disappear.

367,253,Zodiac Race: Art-born animals ,,Buk Seoul Museum of Art Children's gallery,2014-10-07,2015-02-08,,,Seoul Museum of Art ,,Free,,,,,"SeMA Buk Seoul Museum of Art opened on September, 2013. It provides the children’s gallery as part of an exhibition program that reflects on the needs of local community. In the newly created space, the visitors are mostly preschoolers, kindergarteners, elementary school children, and family members. Furthermore in this space, museum has a goal of running an educational exhibitions program that maximizes the viewing experience of the exhibition by fostering children’s appreciation of contemporary artwork and participating in the exhibition related programming. Following the former two exhibitions <Good Morning, Mr. Robot> (the inaugural shows of the museum) and <I ♡ SEOUL>, this third exhibition in the second half of 2014 presents art-born animals, artistic expression of animals - which are familiar subjects for children - by choosing artworks that choose the twelve animals of the zodiac as subject matter of artists’ works. The exhibition proceeds by adopting part of the original story of the twelve zodiac animals and its background. The story begins with the structure that starts from a sky hill where the twelve zodiac animals coexist, presuming the transcendental being of the sky, the staging of a foot race by that existence, awarding the ‘twelve animal signs’, and the power to protect humans to the runners who are tied for from 1st place to 12th place in the order of the arrival time - also granting mysterious powers as additional prize. After children audiences appreciate the twelve animals scattered around the museum with the tour guide - according to the order of the twelve zodiac animals - , they are able to experience the interactive artwork of Seong Joon Choi, which runs the race of life as an adventure by creating an imaginative animal by compositing the twelve zodiac animals. Lastly, with the question of ‘what if there were a new thirteenth zodiac sign?’ the exhibition stimulates the imagination of children audiences and finishes with <A Tale of Cat’s Tail Series> of the artist Zinoo Park who uses a cat - an animal unfortunately not included in the zodiac sign - as a subject matter. Using the subject matter of ‘the twelve zodiac animals’, this exhibition will be an opportunity for young audiences to learn ‘the twelve zodiac animals’, still handed down to us in the present, through the process of searching, seeing and experiencing the artworks in person.

Holidays, Summer Season (Mar-Oct) 10:00?19:00, Winter Season (Nov- Feb) 10:00-18:00 / Mondays Closed ",,,,,,"Buk Seoul Museum of Art is proud to present the Exhibition of Donated Art Works II -  Dongkang Cho Su Ho to commemorate the donation of fifty-five works of art by Cho Su Ho (b. 1924) to the museum in 2010 and to introduce visitors to his world of art. Cho Su Ho, a member of the National Academy of Arts, has been widely admired for the great diversity and creativity he achieved in the Korean art of calligraphy.  This Exhibition consists of about fifty works in several genres ranging from works of calligraphy by old and modern masters to literati paintings, including the works donated by the artist Cho Su Ho - some of which have never before been displayed in public. The exhibition is designed to break away from the chronological format traditionally adopted for retrospective exhibitions and instead present a comprehensive view of the rich and unique aesthetic heritage materialized in his works, which are arranged to show how the artist evolved in his efforts to expand and transform his art by exploring the borders between abstract painting and East Asian calligraphy. The exhibition also displays some of tools and implements the artist used to produce his works, a meticulous reproduction of part of his studio, and a video clip containing an interview in which the artist talks about his life and art, helping viewers deepen their understanding of the exhibited works.  Cho Su Ho was born in 1924 in Seonsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do and was introduced to the basics of calligraphy when he was just five years old. He studied art in Daegu Normal School, and was admitted to the Department of Western Painting at Seoul National University. It was when he was 26 years old and still an SNU student that he won the Special Commendation Prize (Teukseon) at the first National Art Exhibition of Korea held in 1947. Thereafter he won the same prize four more times at the same event, and became the first awardee of the National Art Exhibition Invited Artist Prize in 1974. His studies of western painting during his college years became a precious asset for his career in calligraphy, as they provided him with valuable opportunities to acquire comprehensive knowledge about different categories of art, including literati painting, art history, and artistic philosophy as well as western painting, from distinguished scholars at the university. His academic experience at the university also helped him achieve his own style in the East Asian genre of calligraphy and ink wash painting. His ink wash paintings exploring the relationship between painting and calligraphy are now widely regarded as the precursors of a new vision of Korean calligraphy in the 21st century.       Critics are generally agreed that Cho Su Ho created his own form of art thanks to his progressive attitude and his experiments in harmony between Eastern and Western aestheticism, which contributed greatly to the effort to bring Korean calligraphy to a wider public in Korea and the rest of the world. The works selected for this exhibition are great examples of the artist's belief that 'there exist all kinds of paintings in calligraphy' and his contribution to the artistic development of Korean calligraphy. They are expected to guide visitors to a deeper understanding of Dongkang's art and the new aesthetic sensibility he brought to calligraphy.   The exhibition is expected to guide art lovers to this fine collection of donated works, with the aim of showing the new direction which Cho Su Ho believed the art of Korean calligraphy should follow. It is also intended to shed new light upon the distinguished artistic achievements of this great master calligrapher of our time.  Finally, we, the organizers of the exhibition at the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA), would like to express our sincere gratitude to Master Dongkang and his family for the donation of this outstanding collection of great art works.

The tree creates a wind path along the waterway and the pedestrian path._Between the paths, Nanjido Mound is visible._The waterway runs windingly._The place where water merges forms a swamp._ The waterway passes through Nanjido, the highlands and then ascends to the entrance of a valley and a pier._The Nanjicheon stream flows and stirs up the riverside of the Hangang River. <Atelier Tree, Nanji-do Project, 2000>  <INSTANT LANDSCAPE> consists of experimental resultants acquired from the observation and re-interpretation of various geographical and physical phenomena of Nanjido, which is a garbage landfill that was transformed into a park transformed.  Nanjido is a park formed from a waste dumpsite, and it shows various contrasting duality, such as tangible space from intangible space; a newly created space from a deserted space; an operating space from an ignored space; an industrial energy-generated space from a waste-accumulated space; and a breathing space, where the natural ecosystem is regenerated from contaminated materials. The soil, stones, and trees collected from Nanjido have their own distinct scent. In particular, various scents emitted from each area ? plants blowing from the mound, gas odors leaking from underground, and burning from one corner of a garbage incineration plant ? will all help people imagine the structure of Nanjido.  The surrounding scenery of Nanjido is so beautiful that it deludes people into believing that they are outside Seoul. At the rest place created on the garbage dump, which has extreme contrasting duality, such diversity and characteristics imply several things if we concentrate on small sounds that we can experience. The sounds of winds, birds, insects, electric poles, power plants, and automobiles, which we can easily hear on the surface of the landfill, as well as the sounds of vibration and wavelengths, which are generated from physiological and chemical reactions happening inside waste dumps below the surface of ground, help people associate the present structural frame of Nanjido with its past.  The primary attempt of <INSTANT LANDSCAPE> is to express physiological and chemical reactions, which are generated by wavelengths, vibrations, frictions, gas, and leachate from the surface of upper structures, into exhibition spaces by turning them into sounds through electronic devices. With various sounds collected from the Nanjido site, an attempt is made to re-interpret the ironical, historical duality and structural irrationality of the lower structure 'waste dump' and the characteristics of the upper structure of the surface, which works as a park, from the perspective of our society’s widespread phenomenon of cover-up.  To remind people of the upper surface and lower structures at the exhibition space, the sounds from physiological and chemical reactions are delivered through speakers, and vibrations and sounds are expressed in an overlapping mode by using soil as a medium, which symbolizes the surface of the ground. In addition, the images of Nanjido village, which were accidently captured by the artist during the early winter of 1996, help people recall Nanjido, which used to be a garbage landfill and a historical space, which was isolated from society in the past. They also derive people's interest in Nanjido as a space of possibility and value when the sounds onsite are juxtaposed.■ KIM Joon  ",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_7c6fda931801444f9b4473aab5f5ce62_6c51306acd1344cc9b6350fd2bdbf1b9,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=305,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

This exhibition begins from the exploration of Mundi Vita, that is, ‘lives of the world’ or lives within the world. If art can have a tiny handful of meaning in this contemporary world where all kinds of disasters and dangers lurk, it lies only in the fact that art never ceases to agonize, doubt, and question.   In front of questions such as ‘Is sustainable life possible?’, ’What would be an alternative life to capitalism?’, artists of today ask for the meaning of life in this world. Instead of clear answers, artists testify to the absence of lives and signal towards an immeasurably vulnerable existence through all kinds of gaps, traces, memories, and images left by all the lives in the world. The artists of today endlessly and readily spread their tentacles, groping the absence, breaks, traces, and memories for the living.   By turning the techniques of textile that possess traits of craft into a medium of contemporary art, Cha Seungean’s works that consist of thread and fabrics are a kind of condolence. Cha does this for those who’ve had to bear the trauma of facing reality in the absence of life as well as the all the dangers that endlessly threaten us. Not only this but also acknowledging that the essence of danger originates from ourselves. Particularly, the site-specific installation in the corridor of the 3rd floor in the Seoul Museum of Art comforts us by spreading the fissures and traces of life as condolences in the space.  Lee Hyein records memories and sensibilities in ‘Empty Address’, which created in unpermitted places and is swept away in time, through her unique painting that combines solid architectural compositions and surrealistic elements. The artist shows an artistic examination and response to  the current catastrophes in the new work <Blind Painting>, and in her 2010 work <Ghost Ship> that is an uncanny d?j?vu of the Sewol ferry disaster. These works allow us to hear a voice of introspection and record that tiny handful of meaning that art delivers in a world full of fear.  As a part of a more practical approach, SeMA will hold ‘Reading Event’ and art learning programs for kids. Through these artistic practices we hope to share a belief in the power produced by the human voice and in the very small changes that are potentially created by art.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192845_b369f078750c4e6db1f52f59e50914cb_0a189ebb0f8a420d9811899647c3eca7,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=357,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

835189,187,2013 NANJI ART SHOW III : The Roads of Forking Paths,,SeMA Nanji Residency,2013-05-23,2013-06-02,http://semananji.seoul.go.kr/english/program/exhibition_list.jsp  ,,,2pm-6pm (closed on mondays),,multi-media,8,"Kim Ayoung, Lee Ye Seung, Lee Wonwoo, Lee Changwon, Jeon Mirai ",,"The Roads of Forking Paths  This exhibition began from two points that are unrelated to each other.  The unique composition of the gallery, which is part of the SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY, has become in itself the format of this exhibition. The gallery used to be a wastewater processing facility, but it was renovated into an empty space upon the construction of the NANJI RESIDENCY. The space consists of two independent circular spaces, forming a pair of near-perfect symmetrical spaces. Such symmetrical structures provide the first clue about the exhibition. They were designed so as to co-exist without hierarchy or to contradict each other. The name of the exhibition, The Roads of Forking Paths, which instantly reminds people of a concrete scene, was adopted from the title of a well-known short story, The Garden of Forking Paths, written in 1941 by Jorge Luis Borges. In this story, Borges suggests a multi-layered time structure which encompasses all possibilities. The artists participating in this exhibition planned a pair of symmetrical artworks that contradict each other, or repeat themselves, or run parallel to each other, or complement or conflict with each other, or are dislocated or multi-faceted, or are disintegrated or co-exist. Here, parallelism does not simply pursue a formative parallel, but refers to two possibilities of the same weight which are separated from one thought. Through this process, the artists decided to support a format and content that are related to each other or run away from each other as they embrace the possibility of errors which may evade perfect rationality.   Under a given situation, viewers should understand the exhibition as they actively visit the two spaces. However, it is impossible for them to see the two spaces as a whole due to the characteristics of the space, so they can only see a disconnected, fragmented view. An integration of such views occurs in the brains of the viewers in different time lags. It is similar to presenting two sides of a coin which cannot be seen simultaneously, but it allows viewers to actively derive all possible conclusions. Through this, different times evolve simultaneously like parallel universes which exist in different dimensions within the same time zone.   We are all aware of the unavoidable boredom we may experience in the midst of an easygoing, comfortable life. This exhibition presupposes that experiences with discord and enmity, which evolve from the intermixture of dissimilar elements, can move our thoughts to an area where things of the past have not been realized. Such discord or multiplicity could be one of the basic conditions that prevents our life escaping the magnetic field of discord, absorption or dislocation owing to the expansion of modernity, even though we live in the 21st century.  The artists participating in this exhibition support the notions of ambivalence, compatibility, contradiction, and conflict. When our life accelerates along a straight line, we often imagine other lines which do not easily harmonize as they exist in the margins or below or above. Within a tight net of time which disperses, converges or goes parallel, the lines divide into two parts limitlessly. At this exhibition, two circular spaces, which are symmetrical, tie two forces running in separate directions into a single tension, and they become a place which mediates simultaneous forces stretching out in four directions unnoticeably. Moving to a different location will depend on the viewer’s free will.   ■ Kim A-yeong  <br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>opening reception: 5pm / opening performance: Jeon Mirai",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2F2016%2Fmgimg%2Fimg31%2Feng%2F&FILE_NM=pfile2016_1468461053132.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835189,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The exhibition <Universal Studios, Seoul> presents the works of foreign artists who have been living and working in Korea, and attempts to start a dialogue on the image of Korea that is expressed and perceived in their art, as well as the perspectives that Koreans have towards foreign artists.  The thirteen artists invited to this exhibition come from ten different countries including Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, UK, Spain, Canada, Czech Republic, India, Singapore and Australia.  After arriving in Korea for various purposes, such as work, marriage, studies abroad, or curiosity, these artists have been living and working in Korea for 1 year to 20 years. The artist Emil Goh is also included in this exhibition, whose sudden death in 2009 while working in Seoul prompted a wave of mourning in the Korean art community.  The exhibition’s title, referencing the Hollywood theme park, alludes to the ‘universal’ phenomenon of contemporary nomadic life represented inside these foreign artist’s ‘studios.’ Furthermore, the title signifies the cultural fantasies that naturally present themselves in the encounter between different cultures - for example, a foreign artist’s romantic biases or critical perspectives on Korea, or inversely, the Korean expectation towards foreign artists.  It is natural that the attitude of artists, who see the familiar in an unfamiliar way or the natural unnaturally, develops into an interesting result through the experience of settling in a different culture. This exhibition features works of art that preserve their artistic characteristics prior to migrating to Korea, and works that deal with the situation of Korea within universal themes, as well as artworks that actively employ the specificities of Korean history and culture, politics and division, and urban landscape and daily life, as subject matter. By exhibiting the works of artists, made before and after coming to Korea, this exhibition allows audiences to observe changes within aesthetic attitudes, themes, and subject matter influenced through one’s place of residence.  The exhibition catalogue provides images of artists’ works along with artists’ creative thoughts in the form of text, poetry, drawing, and photography. This textual component was developed through a prompt given to each artist in which they were asked to respond to five key words:‘Home, Language, Cultural Fantasy, Passport, and Seoul.’ In addition to this, through performance, round-table discussions, and artist talks, we will provide an opportunity to examine how artists respond to Korea and Korean culture through different perspectives and expressions.    ● Opening Reception & Performance - 2014. 6. 17. 5-6pm at the exhibition hall (1F)   1.

We are artists who like experimenting and playing with things from perspectives unlike any other in the rest of the world. As such, we have the privilege of being able to enjoy more freedom in Korea than anyone else. However, we have been suppressing our exploding imaginations due to our poverty and limited space, as well as to others’ attention. In search of genuine freedom under the leadership of Park, our captain, we formed a community in Nanji-do, a place where nobody comes. Then we picked up a load of trash and built the Nanji Residency with that trash. The Nanji Residency is not a residency space; rather; it is a space base called SEMA 110-248-463566. Recently, a planet called QUIRA 1218, which is 22 light years away from, and has a similar environment to, the Earth, was discovered. This outer planet is the only space where we can realize our intention free from the interference of any system, format or government officials.     We immediately constructed a kind of transmission/reception tower. Others have misconstrued it as a transmission tower and feel pity for us, but the tower is being used as a radio telescope to determine whether there is any civilized living organism on QUIRA 1218. A nice hydrogen fuel tank has also been built next to the Hangang River. It is decent enough to travel 22 light years. If there is not enough fuel, we can stop by the Sun. We have also built two space ships, one for women, the other for men. The ships are now disguised as exhibition halls. We have built all these facilities by extracting materials from the waste matter on Nanji-do. It took us eight years to complete them.    It is now time to depart. We must leave now. The engine of the space base can no longer stand the pressure of the hydrogen tank. As lubricating oil is leaking through cracks on the cooling box of the engine, a smell like gasoline pervades everything here. We must escape this year, before the base explodes.  According to the calendar of the earth, we will hold a farewell party at 5pm on June 13, 2014 before departing to Quira1218. We will open our spacecraft, and serve our space food to our visitors. We will also showcase the information we have obtained from our observations of space. The radio telescope of the transmission tower has confirmed that organisms similar to human beings are living on QUIRA 1218. It has been confirmed that they live by hunting and fishing---the way of life led by humans before the agricultural revolution. All the things we do will become ‘initial’. They will also become the first legend in the history of art to last into later generations. We hope that visitors will congratulate our glorious new beginning with pleasure.

The exhibition is intended to take a view of a stream of contemporary Korean photography by shedding light on works by six overarching Korean photographers(VIP) who worked in the 1950s and 1960s.   The 1950s and the 1960s was a period when Korean society and the Korean photo-scene underwent considerable change. The situations of the times after the turbulent period of liberation from Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War gave rise to realism, reflecting reality and everyday life, and another art movement exploring the true nature of things within an individualist world. A variety of experiments with such themes and expressive methods served as momentum to extend the category of contemporary Korean photography.   The exhibition consists of two parts: RIHP Collection, and SeMA collection. Vintage photographs1) of Hyun Il Young, Lee Hae Sun and Lee Hyoung Rok chosen from the RIHP Collection display a balance between a documentary photography style and modeling quality, transcending standardized tendencies of realism and pictorialism of the time. Photographs selected from the SeMA Collection are works of Han Young Soo, Hong Soon Tae, and Joo Myung Duck featuring candid aspects of life in Korea, especially in Seoul in the 1950s and 1960s. Their works, anchored to the intrinsic properties of documentary photography, while seeing aspects from a humane perspective, show a vivid sense of reality, capturing aspects and transfiguration of Korean society and life.  The exhibition also enhances viewer understanding of activities and backgrounds by exhibiting relevant magazines and exhibition catalogs that provide information on the trends of the then photographic scene. The 1950s and 1960s was a turning point in contemporary Korean photography history when numerous photographers experimented with intrinsic attributes of photography, record, and choice. The art show will be an opportunity to explore the trace of time of the 1950s and 1960s and share six participating artists’gazes and art-worlds.

The tree creates a wind path along the waterway and the pedestrian path._Between the paths, Nanjido Mound is visible._The waterway runs windingly._The place where water merges forms a swamp._ The waterway passes through Nanjido, the highlands and then ascends to the entrance of a valley and a pier._The Nanjicheon stream flows and stirs up the riverside of the Hangang River. <Atelier Tree, Nanji-do Project, 2000>  <INSTANT LANDSCAPE> consists of experimental resultants acquired from the observation and re-interpretation of various geographical and physical phenomena of Nanjido, which is a garbage landfill that was transformed into a park transformed.  Nanjido is a park formed from a waste dumpsite, and it shows various contrasting duality, such as tangible space from intangible space; a newly created space from a deserted space; an operating space from an ignored space; an industrial energy-generated space from a waste-accumulated space; and a breathing space, where the natural ecosystem is regenerated from contaminated materials. The soil, stones, and trees collected from Nanjido have their own distinct scent. In particular, various scents emitted from each area ? plants blowing from the mound, gas odors leaking from underground, and burning from one corner of a garbage incineration plant ? will all help people imagine the structure of Nanjido.  The surrounding scenery of Nanjido is so beautiful that it deludes people into believing that they are outside Seoul. At the rest place created on the garbage dump, which has extreme contrasting duality, such diversity and characteristics imply several things if we concentrate on small sounds that we can experience. The sounds of winds, birds, insects, electric poles, power plants, and automobiles, which we can easily hear on the surface of the landfill, as well as the sounds of vibration and wavelengths, which are generated from physiological and chemical reactions happening inside waste dumps below the surface of ground, help people associate the present structural frame of Nanjido with its past.  The primary attempt of <INSTANT LANDSCAPE> is to express physiological and chemical reactions, which are generated by wavelengths, vibrations, frictions, gas, and leachate from the surface of upper structures, into exhibition spaces by turning them into sounds through electronic devices. With various sounds collected from the Nanjido site, an attempt is made to re-interpret the ironical, historical duality and structural irrationality of the lower structure 'waste dump' and the characteristics of the upper structure of the surface, which works as a park, from the perspective of our society’s widespread phenomenon of cover-up.  To remind people of the upper surface and lower structures at the exhibition space, the sounds from physiological and chemical reactions are delivered through speakers, and vibrations and sounds are expressed in an overlapping mode by using soil as a medium, which symbolizes the surface of the ground. In addition, the images of Nanjido village, which were accidently captured by the artist during the early winter of 1996, help people recall Nanjido, which used to be a garbage landfill and a historical space, which was isolated from society in the past. They also derive people's interest in Nanjido as a space of possibility and value when the sounds onsite are juxtaposed. ■ Written by KIM Jun <br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>opening performance / 2013.08.29 5pm SeMA NANJI Exhibition Hall",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2F2016%2Fmgimg%2Fimg31%2Feng%2F&FILE_NM=pfile2016_1468472305750.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835194,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

SeMA BLUE exhibition focuses on the artists of aged 30-40s. This year, SeMA BLUE exhibition Malfunction Library pays attention to the highly developed ‘knowledge information society’ in which an access to all sorts of information and knowledge has become easy but choosing the one has become difficult.   9 people/teams of the artists in this exhibition express their critical viewpoints towards the knowledge information society. Although they cannot be called knowledge producers in a traditional sense, they also produce alternative or secondary information/knowledge which may not be included as a mainstream but has potential possibilities through the means of information collecting and processing, and rearranging based on persistent research. Their creative activities are expressed through what seems strange information, the various forms of information surrounding the contemporary, and create ‘Malfunction Library’ which is the total space of the accumulated odd knowledge and information.   The exhibition will be more interesting if you freely walk around the works of ‘Malfunction Library’ which are connected with the infinite ‘links’ and find the operation errors and correct what you used to know, rather than following directions and certain statements. By independently rearranging and re-contextualizing information, you can create new information as an ‘independent thinker’ or ‘alternative knowledge producer’, like the artists of this exhibition.   Through the creative activities of the artists who are living ‘here, now’, SeMA BLUE 2014 Malfunction Library will give you an opportunity to reflect present knowledge/information environment and to think independently. We look forward to seeing your unhindered intervention as an alternative knowledge producer who are not afraid of malfunction but are full of curiosity.

Sound art developed under direct and indirect influence of contemporary art that goes as far back as the Futurist Manifesto’s Art of Noise, leading to more recent figures such as John Cage. This exhibition, by substituting ‘visual space’ with ‘aural space’, looks back on various musicians who appeared in Korea since the 90s, placing them within the context of media technology and subculture.  As an experimental attempt at the very listening mechanism itself, Noise lets the participating musicians’ harmonies mingle altogether and create a ‘garden of noise’. As for the audience, they would use headphones to actively ‘connect’ themselves to live videos or recordings, thus forming individual temporalities. By allowing the audience to use a computer to gather videos, recordings and texts and to create their own DIY leaflets, Noise will provide an active and participatory experience based on performativity― as opposed to passively appreciating a given exhibition, they engage in the production of personalized objects.   The spectrum of participating musicians was expanded to include the earlier generation that began performing since the late 90s, typified by improvisation on noise taken from machines or media, rather than chords or harmonies (Kwon Byung-jun, Ryu Han-kil, Jin Sangtae, Choi Joon-yong, Transistorhead, Hong Chul-ki), and the more recent generation of experimental musicians who form a flexible collaborative system based on electronic music (Graye, Damirat, Rumahan, Byul.org, Mimyo, Miiin, SklavenTanz, Sima Kim, Odaeri, Se Chung, Choi Taehyun, haihm, The Hitchhiker). The underlying intention is to diverge from superficial categorization, such as genres, and to understand the sound art phenomenon within a wider context, namely medium and subculture.  The exhibition is composed mainly of live videos and audios produced by those who are not only front runners of today’s sound art scene, but who are also active in the international field. Commonly used platforms for posting works and communicating with listeners, such as websites and Soundclould pages, are also introduced to shorten the distance between the museum, the audience and the musicians. Not to be missed is the collaborative album by Odaeri and pope x pope, which was recorded specially for the exhibition, and will be displayed along with their live footage. Furthermore, artist talks and workshops, which are scheduled to be held for four sessions, will help better understanding of contemporary art and sound art, and their increasingly diminishing interdisciplinary boundaries. Such efforts will also provide opportunities to promote communication between the musicians and the audience.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192844_34ae43042d9146e1adf383b965d14c60_2ab4c1da524540ac861692153a5609e3,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=345,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Lee was a pioneer who contributed to the development of Korean modernism after studying abroad.   This exhibition consists of the museum's small collection of artworks donated by the artist's bereaved family in 2013, as well as thirty drawings and oil paintings owned by Lee's family and never before disclosed to the public. It will focus on the period during which the artist embodied the 'lyrical abstract space' that characterized his work after the turning point in his career marked by his period of study in Paris, by presenting a series titled Imagery, which consists of his drawings and oil painting from the 1980s and 1990s, and by breaking away from the existing chronological and retrospective method. It will provide visitors with an opportunity to experience the artist's impromptu and subjective style and his rhythmical composition of colors, forms, strokes, lines, and surfaces, along with the five-color structure that he created by adding black and white to the three-primary colors of red, blue, and yellow, which constitutes an important element of his work. The exhibition space is organized in such a way as to improve visitors' understanding of his artworks, and includes a video of an interview with the artist recorded for a program titled TV Art Museum in 1991, which showed the evolution of his art through sketches and drawing books reflecting the artist's ideas.    Lee was born in Seoul in 1921, and studied in Tokyo and Paris. After returning to Korea in the late 1960s, he sought to define the identity of Korean modern art while expanding the scope of his art to such genres as large-scale wall paintings, interior decoration, stainless glass, and tapestry. In addition, he also demonstrated just as much outstanding ability in his work as an art administrator as he did in his career as an artist. He attended the 5th IAA (International Art Association: a UNESCO agency that assists the creative activities of artists) held in Tokyo in 1966, and held the exhibition financed by the Japanese Government for the first time by organizing and presenting the Korean Modern Painting Exhibition in 1968 at the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo. Thereafter, he held a retrospective exhibition in 1991 which looked back on his work during his 50-year career. He served as the first director of the Art Sonje Center. He also attended the CIMAM (International Committee for Museums and Collections of Modern Art) in 1994, and contributed to the construction of the Korean Pavilion for the Venice Biennale between 1993 and 1995.   We would like to express our sincerest appreciation for the donation of works of art by Lee SeDuk, who played a pioneering role in the development of Korean modernism during a time when the art education environment in Korea was very poor. We wish to share the kind consideration of the bereaved family of the artist with the public through this exhibition.  Exhibition of Donated Art Works I ? Hwang Chang Bae     Buk Seoul Museum of Art will be holding the Exhibition of Donated Art Works I to celebrate the donation of the works of art by Hwang Chang Bae(1947-2001). The exhibition highlights the artist's freewheeling style based on his major works from the 90's.  The Exhibition of Donated Art Works I is comprised of his works from the early and mid-90s that were donated by his family, the museum's collections his works from the 80s, and his representative works from the late 90s owned by his family. This exhibition has moved away from the typical format of the retrospective exhibit, which is usually divided by periods, shape, and themes, and instead displays his work based on the late 80s and 90s when the artist reached the peak of his experimental techniques. This allows the visitors to understand the characteristics of his artwork, which incorporates a contemporary feel in the traditional painting method. In addition, Hwang's drawings and painting tools that he used at his artelier in Goesan until he died, and the video data from the TV program TV Art Museum in 1992 are also displayed to increase the understanding of his work.  Hwang Chang-Bae was born in Seoul in 1947 and graduated from the College and Graduate School of Fine Arts at Seoul National University. He also studied engraving and calligraphy under Chulnong Lee Ki Woo and Chinese classics and art history under Im Chang Soon. In 1977, he received a prize from the Minister of Culture and Public Information at the National Art Exhibition, and in 1978, he was awarded the president’s award as an artist of Oriental drawing in non-figurative art for the first at the National Art Exhibition. Then he worked as a professor, and between December 1988 and February 1989 was invited by the U.S. State Department to conduct a project at the New York Artist’s Colony residency. After Hwang visited North Korea as a member of the Research Group of Cultural Heritages in North Korea of the Unification and Culture Research Institute of the JoongAng Ilbo in 1997, he held the “Exhibition of sketching out North Korea” at the Sun Gallery in Seoul in 1998.   We are grateful for the donation of the works of this artist who has contributed to broadening the horizon of Korean painting by expressing the subjects and expressions based on the traditional painting method in a modern style. We also extend our gratitude to the artist's family and the exhibition personnel who helped make this exhibition possible.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192844_ba4ae9f87b5c4822bd43a8661248b224_4a8ea6d6624d4d1f95d38a0b021bba7b,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=342,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

This event will exhibit some 60 artworks from various genres including Korean painting, painting, photography, sculpture, installation art, and new media. The new exhibits have been selected from among the 237 new items collected during 2013.   SeMA's 2013 collection of artworks consists of representative contemporary artworks made with various media, artworks by Korea's representative veteran artists, and artworks that are significant in the history of art. It is hoped that these works, which have been collected in accordance with the new collection policies established by SeMA in 2012, will help visitors understand the recent directions taken by Korean contemporary art. In addition, the new collection will strike a balance between various genres such as Korean painting, painting, drawing & etching, photography, sculpture, installation art, and new media.  The exhibition title, Gift, has the meaning of a communication which intends to share SeMA's art collection with citizens, and is a way of expressing appreciation to the artists who have donated artworks to the collection. In fact, the artworks which have been donated during the last year account for more than 25% of the 2013 collection.   The exhibition hall on the first floor of the main building has been redesigned as a 'Gift Box' to house the new collection, which will establish the identity of SeMA in the coming years. The exhibition will consist of three differentiated sections, namely, box F, box P, and box M, according to the trend demonstrated by the new collection.   This exhibition will provide an opportunity for visitors to perceive the essence of visual art from multi-faceted perspectives, and enjoy various sociocultural discussions on contemporary art through the presentation of the ongoing artworks by young and veteran artists, in addition to artworks that have forged a significant place in the history of art, such as Feminist art, during the 1980s and '90s.

The process often takes place long before the artist is consciously aware, is generated through looking at other artists work, yet also through experiencing things that aren't suspected as having any artistic merit whatsoever. To notice the inflections of information that cause an idea to take root, to chart how a prevailing feeling begets another feeling, and to turn these uncouth phenomenon into an expression which in turn yields more thoughts and feelings, nevertheless, is a task artists seem to do.  A new environment can make the artist aware of their surroundings and allow a fresh look at their practice and energize the development of new work. 『Circular Hands, Centripetal Eyes』 is an exhibition by Gregory Bae, Anna-Lena Tsutsui, L?szl? Csern?tony Luk?cs and Nancy Br?cke the Season 1 International Artists of the 8th SeMA Nanji Residency Program.  The work in 『Circular Hands, Centripetal Eyes』 encompasses a range in approaches and demeanor. From observation and personal reflection to socio-political research and satire, each of the artists jump into the creative cycle at different points to achieve distinct voices. Influenced by their 3 month stay in Korea, the artists in the exhibition have created work marked by their intake of contemporary Korean culture. The work created during their residency is influenced by simply looking around.  Despite the diversity of concepts and styles of each artist, a looping theme gains momentum: either as a formal motif, through self-reflexivity, with repetitive motion and seriality, or as a cross-pollination of ideas and culture. Tangential relationships between each work is also accessible, with no clear beginning and no clear end. This tendency to loop and circumscribe is further emphasized by the rotunda shaped SeMA Nanji Exhibition Halls.   ■ SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY<br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>opening reception: 5pm",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2F2016%2Fmgimg%2Fimg31%2Feng%2F&FILE_NM=pfile2016_1468474776337.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835196,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

By using plants as a medium, this exhibition aims to investigate how a series of groups have been organized and how they are responding to specific political, social and economic issues.   The two artists have been collecting seeds and information that represent groups of artists from around the world which are being operated in a unique form and method. As a result, “The Growing Manual” (2012), which resembles a guide book introducing artist groups, was published. The exhibition “The Growing Manual” can be said to be a live form of the previously-published book. By conducting an experiment of cultivating plants that usually grow in environments, such as Cuba, Mexico, Brazil, Malaysia, and Taiwan, at a new environment and under new conditions such as the Seoul Museum of Art, this exhibition approaches conceptual titles such as “Formation responding to a given condition” and “existence” in a more concrete and direct way.   Plants play a central role in “The Growing Manual,” and the exhibition is divided into three compositions through the medium, “plants”: 1) plants, 2) various forms of information about each group that is represented by plants, and 3) works of art made with sculptural structures that use plants as a medium. Then, why plants? “Plants” are a metaphorical tool used to express the condition and environment of particular areas and to show a form that adapts to a given environment and condition. That is, the 11 species of plants that growing within the gallery are used to describe artist groups that are being operated in a unique method and form as they adapt to a given environment. Various forms of information such as texts, photos, and videos that are suggested along with the plants express the political, social, and economic circumstances of the particular regions to which each group belongs.   This exhibition begins with collecting seeds and ends with cultivating plants. It works like a manual showing the growth process of artist groups that are being compared to plants. Furthermore, it hopes to raise the basic question, 'How can the plants continuously grow in a natural setting?'

Seoul Museum of Art is hosting the Chaos-SunkooYuh exhibition at the SeMA Nam Seoul Living Arts Museum. This exhibition has been brought to you as a part of the national network of municipal art museums, in cooperation with the Clayarch Gimhae Museum.     Sunkoo Yuh is a ceramist who has been engaging in art activities in the US since he graduated from university. After he received the Grand Prize at the Gyeonggi International Ceramic Biennale(GIC Biennale) in 2003, his artwork was introduced to the Korean art arena. He challenges the limitation of sizes of ceramics as a medium, opening up a new horizon in ceramic sculptures beyond the typical techniques used in said genre.     His artworks show figures expressing the multi-layered self as well as a mixture of various symbols of the West and East, such as shapes and figures depicting the influence of Christianity, Buddhism, and Korean traditional folktales and paintings. They portray the journey of his life-his upbringing in Korea and his art life in the US, including his attitudes as a whole and his longing to communicate fundamental human universality that supersedes West and East.     This exhibition showcases ceramic sculptures, hanji (Korean paper) artworks, and ceramic drawings done during his early years as an artist and in recent years. His unique characters started out as plain drawings on hanji paper and changed to multi-dimensional ceramic sculptures. In recent years, he expanded his art world to ceramic drawings that he worked on in Jing de Zhen, China. This exhibition is expected to be an excellent opportunity for visitors to see and experience the artist's unique art world.

SeMa Gold is one of the three SeMA color exhibitions (blue, gold and green) which are held every other year to illuminate on each generation of Korean Art world. SeMA Gold particularly focuses on middle-aged artists of 50s and 60s to view the present situation and future of Korean Art. Through the exhibition <Nobody>, you will be able to see vivid artistic records of the overseas Korean artists whose works are considered another branch of Korean art. The work will show how the artists confronted the world and themselves, who, in the situation of Diasporas, could not belong anywhere but belong everywhere as nobody.   Yong Soon Min (1953~) who is based on Los Angeles, is working as an artist, activist, curator and an art-educator, and deals with the issue of identity that she herself, her parents’ generation and all of us face. Particularly, in this exhibition, she tries to illuminate on ‘nobody’ living with us in Korean society. In other words, she artistically shed light on Diaspora in Korea living under the name of foreign workers, married migrated women, North Korean defectors and refugees. Sook Jin Jo (1960~) is working in New York, and she has been noted for her work which uses and trims abandoned woods to express fundamental energy of life and ultimate cause of existence. To her, something abandoned, discarded and useless are represented as ‘nobody’, but this ‘nobody’ is rather a trace and key to the most important secrets of life. Jin-me Yoon (1960~) who is based on Vancouver, Canada, is an artist who has been inquiring into the problem of place and identity in a post-colonial aspect. Her works show how Mother Nature such as swamp, bush and grassland, and the shadow of civilization such as city, war and disaster are experienced through her body. Jin-me Yoon’s works imply artistic possibility of overcoming ‘nobody’, as an artist of ‘nobody’ herself.      Seoul is also becoming a foreign land with so many immigrants and people leaving their homes. Through this exhibition, try to follow the artistic paths of the three women artist Yong Soon Min, Jin-me Yoon, and Sook Jin Jo who sought to build their own artistic world for more than 20-30 years at the crossing point of different cultures in a foreign land. Furthermore, reflect on certain aspect of Korean society with the viewpoint of foreigners, minorities, women and strangers like they did. Notably, the exhibition will be more interesting if you can compare how the three artists differently expressed the issue of identity which they continuously confronted in a reinforced situation of outsider as non-western, women artists.

This exhibition started from a modest proposition: “Invisible unless we pay attention.” It deals with the real stories of 35 million refugees worldwide and 350 refugees in Korea and makes “invisible people” visible through on of the most advanced technology, the 3D miniature. Refugees who may be unfamiliar to most Koreans can be defined as “People who are outside their own country because they have suffered persecution or they fear of persecution on account of race, religion, political opinions, or ideas.” Just half a century ago, Korea also had many refugees from the Korean War. Statistics related to refugees are not well known, but the number of refugees coming to Korea is steadily increasing. Many refugees come to Korea with hope, referring to Korea as “the homeland of Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of UN,” or “a nation of human rights.” As of the end of November 2013, more than 6,400 people have made a refugee application to the Korean government; some 350 applicants recognized as refugees are living in Korea. In recent years, saeteomin people (North Korean defectors) are have become an issue in Korea. They have been living in Korea, but they are treated as invisible people.   For this exhibition, palm-sized 3D miniatures were produced based on videos of actual refugees such as the ones living in Korea and camps in Nigeria, Africa; stories about each refugee are presented at the museum of art via digital media. Dozens of 3D miniatures of refugees are installed in crevices in the museum, such as stairs, window sills, and shelves in restrooms; for each miniature has QR and NFC codes so that visitors can see videos of the stories of actual refugees associated with the figurines just by connecting with their cell phones. In addition, since the codes are connected to official SNS, visitors can personally send encouraging messages to refugees.  However, visitors may not be able to see the refugees clearly due to unpredictable circumstances or owing to the small size of videos. If more people have the chance to meet refugees, and become curious about their stories, the refugees themselves will no longer remain as invisible people, and they will get more attention from the world.

It will be held at four public art museums in Seoul, Daejeon, Gyeongnam, Gwangju under different themes.   The exhibition is trying to portray multiple identities of people navigating in an increasingly complex media environment today. This includes works by photographers (Koo Sang Mo, Chanmin Park, Seung Woo Back, Seo Yeoung Won, Taewon Jang, Heeseung Chung, Han Sungpil); by video and installation artists employing photography (Youngmin Kang, Moonho Lee, Lee Sang Hyun, Cho Yikyung, Ha Tae-Bum); by a photojournalist (Park Jongkeun); and a participatory video installation work composed of photos people uploaded on SNS(Cha Ji-ryang).   '4 AM' in the subtitle is derived from the short novel 'Mapping in Darkroom', which was published by Lee Sang, a Korean writer, in 1932 under his pen-name Bigu. In the story, '4 AM' is the moment when the main character meets his other self - Lee Sang- when he goes to bed at 4 am. Thus, the subtitle “4 AM” does not necessarily mean time but a metaphor of “a new dimensional space.” Falling half asleep, Lee Sang goes to the movies, to a zoo and to a restroom as he walks around between time and space without knowing whether it is a real or imaginary world. It is as if he is spending a whole day on an imaginary map.   Media images, which directly reflect lives of people in the present times, are parallel to “light in the night,” as well as to “the self” which plays multiple roles within the media environment. In 1932, Lee Sang sleeps with the fluorescent light on until the early morning. In 2014, people check in their Facebook or play music videos on YouTube, or look at photos on Instagram and Twitter with the light off in a dark room as if they rummage through their Smartphones. 'Mapping the Darkroom' or an imaginary map, which Lee Sang drew while sleeping, has become our reality today.  We now live in a new world where the virtual and real, the genuine and fake, you and I co-exist in space and time, and where intermixed images and texts have a existential value in society. People often experience a mixed feeling of isolation and solidarity at the same time as they wade through this disorderly space. Photography and Media: 4 AM attempts to offer viewers time to think about the uncertainty of the self, memory, scenery and floating images and information which cannot be clearly defined or in a state that any definition is no longer meaningful.    ***Artist Talks at Exhibition Hall*** 2014.

288,185,<Total Theatre: Interspace Dialogue>,,3F of Seosomun Main Building,2013-05-07,2013-05-26,,,Program Partnership、Off and Free International Expanded Cinema and Art Festival,"Weekdays 10:00-20:00 / Weekends, Holidays 10:00-19:00",,"Architecture, Experimental Films","64 items (45 invited items, 19 competition items)",,,"    <Total Theatre: Interspace Dialogue>  Total Theatre is the name of a multi-purpose transformational theatre that was designed by 1927 by Walter Gropius, the then director of Bauhaus, upon request of theatre director Erwin Piscator. At that time, many theatrical stage plays were produced around Europe, but as film screening gained popularity, establishment of a multi-purpose theatre that could put on plays and films was being attempted. Technology that creates space by integrating technology and all fields of visual art, such as architecture, painting, sculpture, design, etc., in order to study stages and produce theatrical spaces, is an expression of civilization and culture, and it is also in concert with the expression of thought.   Total Theatre: Interspace Dialogue, an architecture exhibition and film festival, borrows Gropius and Piscator’s concept of a new kind of theatre to realize a cinema inside of the white cube of a museum. Especially, by renting mass-produced industrial materials or receiving defective products, which were sorted out and discarded during the production process, from sponsors, attempts were made to adopt recycling or upcycling, a term that became a social issue of our time, to building structures. Added to that, by using different material properties taken from ordinary industrial products from our everyday lives such as forklift pallets, plastic chairs that are used in events, felts that are used as dust covers at construction sites and bicycle tires, viewers’ tactile experience of stage devices, rather than simple visual experiences, were induced.   Off and Free International Expanded Cinema and Art Festival, program partner of Total Theatre, will be showing artistic and experimental pieces, with a selection of 64 films under the title, Interspace Dialogue. Off and Free International Expanded Cinema and Art Festival, turning 5th this year, means to get off existing commercial film system, and become free from box office profit. It is a not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to extend the field of film as a total concept that meets changing times, to discover non-commercial film that are original and of high quality, and gain transparency in running a film festival.   As a pre-biennale to the biannual Seoul International Media Art Biennale Mediacity Seoul, the largest event held by Seoul Museum of Art, Total Theatre: Interspace Dialogue, through a combination of experimental films and buildings that were designed under the concept of ‘flexible buildings and theatres that are capable of transforming and refreshes the mind by its spatial impact’, is a challenge for a new form of exhibition, and also an exhibition that actively reflects the post-museum vision of Seoul Museum of Art.   ■ Bilateral Theatre by KOOK Hyoung-gul  Bilateral Theater is a space that is opened to both sides. Audiences, who are spread around the bilateral projection screen, sit to gaze at each other. They watch films, and they watch whoever's there on the other side. Under such arrangement, free and without any sense of direction, the audience may take whatever position that's most comfortable for them.  Kook is an American registered architect and assistant professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, and works as an architect. As an architectural designer at Weiss/Manfredi in New York, Kook has earned a wide range of experience, including structure installation to urban and landscaping project.   ■ Plushscape by Max Kuo  Plushscape is an immersive installation which seeks to agitate and amplify the somatic conditions of the viewers’ bodies providing more spatial possibilities in their haptic response to the screening films. The installation design consists of nodal points created from bolts of bujikpo that are woven into soft seating pouches and then attached to a rigid frame. These spongy nests allow for group lounging in a variety of positions and also serve as vertically peaked features within the gallery.  Max Kuo is a founding partner in the networked architectural design collaborative ALLTHATISSOLID and His award-winning firm has engaged in built and conceptual proposals throughout the U.S., China, Korea, and Maylasia. Currently living and practicing in Seoul, Kuo is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Architectural Design at Soongsil University.  ■ Society of Architecture by Imponderabilia  Imponderabilia is placed in a crystal room, and bolts are used in a way that more and more emphasizes the narrow and high form of the room. Materials that make up the structural type of the bolt are 350 mass-produced and rentable parasol chairs. By transforming the method of piling, the parasol chairs were born again to an architectural element which has a certain volume.  Founded by Yerin Kand and Chi Hoon Lee in 2010,  SOA place their focus on discovering and comprehending various architectural and urban themes and goes on to develop and experiment with spatial systems, materials, methods of construction and building types of many different constructed environments, varying in size from buildings to cities.  ■ Interspace by Interface by OH Sang-hoon Interface has two meanings: the boundary between two kinds of systems or devices that are combined and the space in between interspaces. Interspace by Interface uses space and waste tires to show the phenomenon of a change of relationship that results from the death of an object.

From humanscale to cityscale, CTR conducts research on explicit and implicit pockets, and goes on to study a series of  figurative and spatial, as well as economical, social and cultural forms, thus suggesting structures that are applicable to construction environments.

The artists are from the so-called “Otaku” generation, who live and work as individuals. In their paintings, they become an interface itself to link everyday reality to virtual reality by integrating themselves with mass media. This attitude differs themselves from Pop Art that appropriates images from mass media with a political, philosophical and sociological criticism.   On the painting surface composed of various materials such as copperplate, drafting film and glass, there appear super heroes or melodramatic scenes from TV dramas with cartoon imagination. They display a consumeristic attitude that is self-conscious of others’ eyes and a narcissistic manner caused by ego-centric thinking. These reflect their personal viewpoints of the reality manufactured by mass media overflowed with materialism and represent our desires and the zeitgeist.

The Seoul Focus exhibition (previously titled the Seoul Art Exhibition) is celebrating its 28th anniversary this year. The preceding 27th exhibition was a turning point that saw a breakaway from the conventional exhibition format and suggested a new direction for the Seoul Art Exhibition, with a focus on special exhibitions to be held under various themes and issues through specific media.  As the new name of the Seoul Art Exhibition (held annually throughout the long history of the Seoul Museum of Art), Seoul Focus alludes to the staging of special exhibitions with more clearly defined themes.  Under the theme of Modern Korean Painting, this exhibition attempts to shed light on the future vision of Korean painting in the midst of contemporary art trends by inviting artists who have majored in Korean painting and who continue breaking new ground in terms of format and content. To explore this new movement in Korean painting which emerged around 2000, the exhibition will focus intensively on the creative tendency among artists who are now in their 30s and 40s and who are experimenting freely under the influence of the 1st generation, who opened up a new field in Korean painting after much experimentation with traditional Korean writing brushes and ink sticks.   This exhibition aims to enhance visitors’ understanding and appreciation of the production techniques of Korean painting by offering a number of exhibition-related programs specially designed to enable them to try their hand at applying techniques of Korean painting themselves with the help of participating artists.   Through the voice of contemporary artists who are at the juncture between traditional genres and an exciting new contemporary art field and who are engaged in a quest for new ideas, this exhibition will suggest a new direction for future artists and serve as a great venue where visitors can sense the evolution of Korean painting.

It The will showcase an unconventional exhibition where the paintings by artists Jang Jinhwa and Kim Taeho co-exist with antique stoves at an elegant exhibition space of the SeMA Living Arts Museum. The space was formerly the Belgium Consulate in the Modern Age.   Introduced for the first time at the exhibition, the antique stoves are a collection by the artist, Jan Hwajin. These types of stoves were once common throughout Korea, Japan, and Europe. Their dated details show their functions of warming up a home or cooking food. Moreover, their craftwork reveals the popular designs and the technological development of each era.    Jang Hwajin and Kim Taeho, who are Korea's renowned artists, present their modern take on the antique stoves, and introduce their recent artworks through the artists' independent exhibitions. By reinterpreting the antique stoves and the SeMA Living Arts Museum with their unique individualities, the two artists reveal a world of elegance that evokes meditation and healing in the current, contemporary period and space. The exhibition, Atelier with Stoves will offer new, aesthetic experiences that cross the boundaries between practical and pure art.        1st Floor:  Jang Hwajin's Modern Taste (Exhibition Halls 1-5)   Among his recent artworks, artist Jang Hawjin presents a modern taste series through floor tile painting, along with his presentation of the antique stoves. The artist's new artworks are introduced by using the old tiles in the current SeMA Living Arts Museum as a motif, along with the artworks related to the history of modern times, including the architecture of Jeonggwanheon and Jungmyeongjeon Halls of Deoksugung Palace. These artworks, which incorporate the artist's philosophy, will provide an elegant, artistic space with traces of the past life through antique stoves.            2nd Floor:  Kim Taeho's Mindscape (Exhibition Halls 6-11)  Artist Kim Taeho’s recent artworks and his formative beauty of antique stoves will be presented at this exhibition. The mindscape atelier, which used to be the artist's workspace, is a form of installation art that symbolizes the artist's philosophy and world of art.

Almost ten years have passed since then, and the members and structure of the organization team have changed as well. Compared to Europe and USA, which revitalized the concept of residency in the 1970s, in order to accommodate various artists and their expressions, the adoption of the residency system in Korea happened relatively late. However, the formation of a productive system of residency in the last ten years, thanks to the hard work and effort of the early organization team, is both commendable and promising.   Although the residency started out as a creative space in Korea as in other countries, it has now begun to fulfill the function of an intermediate space by utilizing its unique advantages. The system of residency assists artists as it functions as both platform and incubator, and also serves an important function in forming a relational network in the art arena. Even though the system was established relatively recently, it has now become an important agency in the art arena. It is time to review the activities and expansion of residencies in Korea   RESIDENCY, NOW is an exchange exhibition of residencies located in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon. The system of residencies started late in Korea compared to other countries, but it now plays a core role in global exchange, and the organizations which serve as hubs in Asia also participate in the residency system of Korea. Artists who represent each residency and are part of the system also participate in this exhibition, and are recommended by the curators of each residency. In addition to this exhibition, a talk with the curators and artists is also arranged. Curators who are now in charge of organizing new programs, having grasped the baton from their predecessors, will provide information about the current mode of program and process of change of each residency, and discuss and suggest more effective program measures and future planning from a critical viewpoint. The diagnosis of such residencies may predict new phenomena.   The agencies participating in this exhibition include Gyeonggi Creation Center, Incheon Art Platform, and SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY, which has resulted in limiting the scope of this exhibition. However, the scope will be gradually expanded in the coming years, and dialogue is sure to become more fruitful. We sincerely hope that this exhibition will herald the advent of such a driving force.  ■ PARKSOONYOUNG  Gyeonggi Creation Center presents 7 artists as 'Joo Jae Whan with good fellows' in RESIDENCY NOW exhibition: Joo Jae Whan, Jun-Sik Park, minah Son, Daeil Lee, Jeoung Kiheoun, Taewon Heo. Joo Jae Whan with good fellows have been practicing in terms of 'Public Art' making more intimacy to the public by their works. In other words, they make spectators considering whether this is an art or not throughout their activities such as humor but still critical, shelf project for communication, picture-taking project with people in Daebudo, where GCC located, music and sound project with blind children, planting flowers with people, Art hen house, Art-Taxi, these artists are pioneers to provide us more questions between art and art in everyday life. Although this is not the whole explaining of GCC but the special part of engaging various communities around as well as trying other characters in art itself. Titled 'Operation-13 Black Beads,' this work will take a part of the narratives of the overall project. The 13 Black Beads in the video move spontaneously to collide with one another to roll another way to collide with other beads and transfer their own movements. By doing so, they are showing their spontaneous movement or something that appears as spontaneous movement, as well as the transfer of forces created by such movements. CHOI Sungrok collects the stories of violence, memories, fantasy, and technologies in modern society through various types of media to dismantle and reconstruct them again in the form of animation, drawing, and/or installation arts. They would either adopt complex epic structure over the passage of time or a series of incidents, or reveal the double sided montage of play and violence. He closely observes social and environmental issues dealt in media, especially the relationship between animation and public character. Soon to be exhibited 'Operation Mole' is special montage of animation and installation art made of 8 different animations but connected into a single story of the artist's memories against the backdrop of political and historical incidents. The journey into the underground and the stories of mission and love of Mole Tank and a Pilot consists of eight different scenes and historic events during the pilot's time travel. The eight scenes are made of a piece of panoramic scenery, four structural scenes of Pilot and Tank and their underground journey, and three sceneries of the background. JUNG Jihyun kept questioning the functionality and diverse perspectives of urbanization with the spaces and buildings rise and fall in cities. In his 'Construction Site' series, he captured the construction sites of New Town cities including Chungra Incheon, Pangyo Bundang, and residential areas in downtown Seoul. He leads us to look through the clash point of 'destruction of the nature' in the construction of large apartment complex against 'creation' of shelter more than a roof over the heads of modern city dwellers. He then portrays the cold and rational places of construction site into individual but sentimental places. Through this creational installation and discovery, he brings our attention to the conflicting and contradictory gap between them. Originally inspired by the story related to 'freind' in Animal Farm (1945) by George Orwell, the installation suggests a reinterpretation on the real meaning of friend and friendship in our society in general, and a further discussion on collaboration and coexistence in art production. The mosaic generated movie associated with the fiber optic installation 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' and the kinetic light art 'You Were My Sunshine, My Only Sunshine' on the set deliver a message from the sound and lyric itself. A living room where friends are in faces some sort of dilemma. It represents a space where we would recall the events occurring between social media and individuals, corporations and clients, or networks and users. The living room as a space where fictional and real stories are overlapped engages in subversion of the space of comfort and privacy. The private sphere more and more expands to the public domain. The living room seems still closed, but it is strategically opened as an architectural place where we possibly penetrate into the network. Without knowing the fact that anonymous spectators appeared as 'friends' become participants, the audience eventually plays the main character on the set of the installation. In other words, 'friends in the living room' portray us as being constantly watched and evaluated by others through the network forme. 'Feedback Field' is project inspired by sounds of the city that are inaudible to the human ear. This project aims to analyze digitally encrypted wavelengths through sounds, based on theories of urban space, such as topology, geography, geophysics. We can find radar sites near park, check the routes of flying object above graveyards, and take an interest in the influence of numerous power stations (wind energy, nuclear power) on urbanites. It is through this encrypted phenomena that are delivered through silent electronic wavelengths, which enable us to take these actions. The main subject of 'Feedback Field' are electromagnetic fields (EMF) that are produced in the city and influence mankind. I converted wavelengths of EMF collected from the field, which consist numerous electronic wavelength that dominate the city, into sounds for people to hear on-line.

This year, the newly renamed assistance program has been expanded to include various genres of art, in order to reflect the new trends of contemporary art in accordance with the museum’s intention of supporting talented artists working in various experimental genres. Furthermore, whereas the assistance previously focused on solo exhibitions, this year’s exhibition consists of a joint exhibition of works by 28 artists.   The title of this exhibition,“Round-Up,”is a news and media term referring to ‘a summary of recent facts and events’. The exhibition is designed to showcase the representative artworks of twenty-eight artists who have held solo exhibitions around Seoul during 2013 with the museum’s assistance. It attempts to express the passion and pure desire of these young artists by configuring various artworks by the selected artists, which cannot be defined under one theme, in an intentionally-exaggerated or conflicting fashion within the exhibition hall.   The Artist Relay Event will enable visitors to enjoy various forms of artwork during the exhibition period through direct communication with contemporary artists who might otherwise be perceived as distant or difficult. In addition, the exhibition will feature an exhibition space introducing ‘The New Artist Exhibition Assistance Program,’ along with data related to the solo exhibitions of twenty-eight selected new artists, to enable visitors to see the progress of the exhibition assistance program over the past six years, and to review the role and future direction of the program.   It is hoped that this exhibition will provide a valuable opportunity for visitors to enjoy a wide spectrum of contemporary artworks by passionate young artists, as well as various events such as Artist Relay Event.

322,211,"Analog Welcome, Digital Archive",,"NANJI RESIDENCY, NANJI Exhibition Hall",2013-11-16,2013-12-15,,,Seoul Museum of Art,2pm ~ 6pm(Close Mon.),,,,,,"Foreword on <Analog Welcome, Digital Archive>  PARK Soonyoung | Curator, SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY   SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY (SNR) opened in 2006 at a refurbished obsolete water treatment facility. From the beginning to 2009, it has been serving its role as a creative studio by providing working spaces to aspiring artists. Since 2010, it also has transformed itself as a residency program by utilizing the advantage of a residency being strong in forming network and communicating with public institutions. In the year of 2013, there has been many changes in SNR. Following the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA)'s 2012 vision, Post Museum, SNR has expanded the scope of its activities to outside of the country by forming international network.    Forming network through exchange is most important in a residency program, and it has a strong advantage to operate so. This is one of the main objectives of the artists participate in residency programs, and residency programs operate in a way to effectively meet the objective. SNR has excellently established its foundation as a creative studio, and expanded its activities to a global level. SNR joined the  international residency network hub, Res Artis, and select artists from the international contests, and promotes international exchange exhibitions every year. This November, SNR opens an exchange exhibition with Songzhuang Art Center, in Beijing, China. Regarding the variety of Contemporary art, the extent of exchange should not be restricted in domestic, but should be promoted internationally. <Analog Welcome, Digital Archive> is one of the practices for this cause. Organized by the Alternative Space Loop, this exhibition will create a platform in SNR to introduce the leading institution in Media art around the world.   Directors of the participating institutions such as Bernhard Serexhe from ZKM, Germany, and HatanaKa Minoru from ICC, Japan and more will attend the Open studio event on the day of the exhibitions' opening. By giving introduction of the artists' works and mentoring program, SNR would like to provide an opportunity to the residency artists to develop networks. SNR also expect to achieve art historical research on media artists and share archives of each institutions, in addition to becoming a change to develop SNR's international network.  Analog Welcome, Digital Archive Daewon Hwang, Curator, Alternative Space LOOP   Concepts and roles of archive are changing and stretching along with the development of digital technology. Archives find themselves in front of an unprecedented task, as computer files replace stacks of paper or reels of film that used to serve the purpose of documentation and storage in the past. As concerns a new dilemma over technological gap between old and new materials, for instance, a fresh perspective will be drawn from saving and reproduction of digital files or preservation and sharing of documentation, which have become easier than ever through the Internet. When it goes to visual art, digital archive transforms approaches to the form of video art in particular, not to mention its contribution toward the preservation of various publications and images produced on the occasion of each exhibition.  	Analog Welcome, Digital Archive is an exhibition based on the participation of nine leading institutions that represent the field of media art or video art. Participants from each institution submitted two media works selected from their own archive, according to historical significance of an artwork in relation to the archive or the situation of video medium after the 1960s. This show exemplifies a new phase of video art exhibition enabled by the emergence of digital archive. To elaborate, video has now become available to be transmitted as DVD or media file and shown in any locality in a quality equivalent to the original, without visiting relevant institutions via airplane or transporting film from one location to another.  	Even so, despite the considerable development of technology, an exhibition of exchange is still not easy as one may think, especially when the items to be share between institutions are video “works.” As Bernhard Serexhe, one of participating curators, pointed out during the preparation of this show, it is a mistake to assume the right to disclose something to everyone in every site simply because it is “digital.” An artwork protected under copyright is supposed to be prohibited from arbitrary distribution and each organization adheres to a different set of rules concerning the operation and release of digital archive. Therefore invigoration of an archive exchange project requires constant meetings and discussions, which are the part that cannot be comforted by digital technology. Add to this, the exhibition itself that presents moving image to the viewers is a place governed by the physical restrictions of space and time, filled with heavy equipment. Although art archive goes digital, it is analog on which inviting everything to one spot heavily relies.  	Analog Welcome, Digital Archive is an experiment devoted to sustainable archive sharing projects in the future. The charms of video works featured in this show speak for the reason that all sorts of actual and analog labor are necessary to archive sharing. The essence of archive resides in the preservation of documentation, which in turn is one of the most basic forms of history. Chosen with particular attention to the term “history,” the works participating in this exhibition carry monumental meaning as preserved material, alongside their primary meaning as art. Whether it is an old black and white film or a recent record, or a social practice or a silent performance, these videos allude to stories saturated in artistic image. They are not only documentations of the long gone past, but also scenes that we should not be able to run into if materials were not stored. There still remain new things in the past. It is the encounter in the present, not old memories, what archive exhibition welcomes.

Korea is experiencing a great change in public architecture and innovative design. All fields of design and public architecture are gaining importance as a means to for people to achieve true happiness, and social welfare, and to create a better world for generations to come. The Seoul Museum of Art and Sonoann will be introducing different styles of architecture and designs that embody the philosophies of five Nordic countries, with the hope that the exhibition will suggest a new direction for Korea’s future.  Nordic Passion: Architecture & Design from the Nordic Countries is an international exchange project that is based on the research of curator and Sonoann Director, Amie Ann, who has traveled back and forth between North Europe and Korea multiple times over the past decade. Architects, designers, and educational institute staff from Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Sweden will participate in the exhibition and take part in the exchange. The exhibition will be an excellent opportunity to encounter the latest Nordic philosophy, design concepts, and social innovations. Nordic design, which is minimal and functional, is based on the premise of all humans being equal, a consideration for the environment, and visions for the next generation. The schools of the Nordic countries are assertively creating an educational environment that combines elements of society and family. The exhibition will also offer a closer look into Northern European schools that have been designed to help pupils learn and experience social life.   Part 1: Schools/Learning by Doing Exhibition Design : FORTUNEN  Education is the pillar of democracy and the symbol of public welfare in the Nordic countries. It is the measure of social and economic development. Finland’s school system has been highly rated by the OECD’s international scholastic achievement comparison research and has been the center of international attention. A school’s architectural design is directly linked to high-quality education and educational experience. This section exhibits models and videos of school architecture. Also in order to allow the audience to experience the interior of an actual school a 1:1 scale replica of a Norwegian schoolroom that was built with the help from Norwegian architects from Bergen Academy of Art & Design will also be on display.    Part 2: Sustainability / Wooden Architecture Exhibition Design :PEKKA HEIKKINEN, PHILIP TIDWELL(Aalto University) & Museum of Finnish Architecture  Wood is the most popular construction material in Northern Europe. Nature, more specifically the forest, has been the inspiration for art and architecture. Forests have long been the source of food, shelter, and materials for humans. This section introduces wood architecture that is unique to the Nordic countries and efforts that have been made to find sustainable ways to continue building wooden architecture using new technologies and building skills. There will be a part of a life-sized wooden structure shown with ten public architectural structures that are made of wood. The exhibition was organized in collaboration with the Museum of Finnish Architecture (aka the MFA) and Aalto University.    Part 3: Meeting Places / Designs for Public Spaces Experience a Day in a Nordic Town Exhibition Design :ANTTI YLI-TEPSA from KIASMA, Finland  This part of the exhibition recreates a handful of spaces that any Northern European would be familiar with. Putting people and the environment first, the designs are made from high quality wood by a skilled carpenter. Wooden homes are handed down from generation to generation. Interior d?cor from Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland are displayed inside the wooden model homes to give them more life. On the other side of the exhibition hall you will find “Grandma’s Summer House,” which is a small wooden home that integrates tradition and modern design.

Among others historical memory could distinguish physical or metaphysical, private or communal, sacral and profan, real and virtual spaces. Although the four foreigner exhibitors have their own individual art practice, method and artistic purpose still all of them would seek (sometimes in a critical way) the special relationship between contemporary space and artwork. In fact, the space hasn''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''t possessed anymore constant and obvious definitions, now it has more transitional overlapping meanings. Since timelessness of 20th century has been replaced by acceleration and unpredictability, artwork itself hasn’t been already the symbol of eternity rather an instantaneuos impression of transformation. The rapid flow of information has changed our perception of time that’s why the spatial seems more relevant than ever. Michel Foucault was one of the first philosophers who claimed that our age is the age of space. His ’heterotopia’ conception refers to spaces of otherness, which are neither here nor there, simultaneously physical and mental and above all heterogeneous. Foucault’s concept distinguishes between utopias, which are sites with no real place, and heterotopias, which are places absolutely different from all the sites that they reflect and speak about. Heterotopia is a non-linear sense which is inherent in contemporary societies. We have to accept that almost all cultural phenomenons thus the libraries, museums, galleries and perhaps the residency programs are also heterotopic.   ■ Text by No?mi Szab?, art historian<br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>opening reception: 5pm",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2F2016%2Fmgimg%2Fimg31%2Feng%2F&FILE_NM=pfile2016_1468472640405.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835195,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

So far, Mediacity has been introducing new and exciting interdisciplinary practices of media art, drawing on influences of contemporary science, philosophy, and new technology. Now reaching the 7th edition, the biennale aims to show a multitude of interests that captivates the world of contemporary media art today. The 7th Seoul International Media Art Biennale will open from 11th September ~ 4th November 2012. The theme of this year’s biennale is ‘Spell on You’. This proposes to imagine a vision for a new world and society in two ways. On the one hand, it will show how the recent production of new technology and social media is generating various renewals in social communication and exchange. On the other hand, it aims to reinterpret art and technology in an attempt to re-envision our future, and find alternative ways of living. Against this background, this exhibition will highlight the notion of a ‘Spell’ to convey active and direct modes of communication. It is hope that ‘Mediacity’ can bring an illuminating insight into the current dynamic shifts in contemporary art and technology. ‘Spell on You’ brings together works by approximately fifty artists from all over the world. Jinsang Yoo is the artistic director of the 7th Seoul International Media Art Biennale, and he will be joined by three renowned curators of contemporary media art; Yukiko Shikata (Independent curator based in Tokyo), Olof van Winden (Director of Netherlands Media Art Institute, NIMk), and Dooeun Choi (Former Creative Director of Art Center Nabi/ Co-curator of The Zero1 festival at San Jose).  About Mediacity Seoul 2012 “Spell on You” ‘Spell on You’ proposes to explore the overpowering influence of a spell, encapsulated in the song ‘I Put a Spell on You’ by Screamin’ Jay Hawkins, an American blues singer and songwriter. This exhibition will question the wider technological means of utilizing the media in the 21st century, and expose the current social and political contexts in which the recent phenomena of Social Networking Services such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have globally surfaced the Internet. The exhibition brings together new and recent works by approximately fifty international artists from all over the world.   □ Seoul Museum of Art  1F Media Theatre : Everything Will Be Alright  The entry to the exhibition on level one begins with 'M?moire', a video piece by Adel Abdessemed. This part of the exhibition introduces the scope media, and narrates stories of conflict and confrontation, crisis and challenge, voyeurism and spontaneity. In an attempt to make sense of contemporary media and technology, a variety of works unravel the overwhelming spell of technology through critical as well as poetic visual interpretations.   2F Thousand Spells : On Transmigration of Unknown Friends  Social networking websites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube drastically changed the world that we live in today. Technological advancements led to the mass distribution of information and opinions, which instigated a new kind of democracy as well as economic instability.   3F Crosstalking : Invisible but 'Hello'  The exhibition on level three elucidates how contemporary art productions aim to go beyond the purpose of showcasing new technology. Instead, they explore human empathy in order to escape from feeling invisible, which has become a normative part of modern life. It can be said that the notion of ‘invisibility’ manifests from the overwhelming sense of being subsumed by technique, which leads to fear and alienation.   DMC Gallery  Patterns of Cloud : Getting to Know What The World Feels  The technology of data collection and analysis began from military technology, which moved on to develop applications that enabled private conversations and emotional exchanges. As a result, better communication and network systems are creating more room for exchanges. At the same time, the capital and authority of technology increasingly risks being intrusive to our own private spaces.   □ Participating Artists  Adel Abdessemed, Marina Abramovi?, Romy Achituv, Zbyn?k Baladr?n, Bang&Lee, Maurice Benayoun, blablabLAB, David Bowen, Jae-eun Choi, David Claerbout, dNA(doubleNegatives Architecture), everyware, exonemo, Dennis Feser, NinaFischer&MaroanelSani, Dominic Gagnon, Haque Design + Research, Jonathan Harris & Sep Kamvar, Jenny Holzer, Hong Seung-Hye, HONG Sungmin, HYBE(Hive for Hybrid Environment), Ryoji Ikeda, Yeondoo Jung, Floris Kaayk, So Kanno & Takahiro Yamaguchi, JK Keller, Jeong Han Kim & BiKE Lab., Kichul Kim, Kim, Won Hwa, Aaron Koblin&Chris Milk, Donghee Koo, Ryota Kuwakubo, Robert Lepage&Sarah Kenderdine&Jeffrey Shaw, Alessandro Ludovico & Paolo Cirio, Eric Maillet, Daito Manabe & Motoi Ishibashi, Nathaniel Mellors, Seiko Mikami, Joon Y.

Participating children started their personal journey to imagination using various themes such as dream, imagination, books, and fairy tale.  What are children? Children are children because they have dreams. As long as they continue to have dreams, they will remain children; and because they dream within their dreams, they are children. This itself is a characteristic of children!   As humans age, they gradually veer away from their dream, tread on the land of reality, and bravely start the hard journey called “life.” Their courage or ability to walk begins from a childhood dream, preparing for their life. The title of this exhibit is “Never-Ending Story: Our Limitless Imagination,” decided based on our wish for children's imaginary world where children's dream, fairy tale, and fantasy continue in life.   Through this exhibit, we wish for many more children to have greater imagination and for adults to take some time to reminisce on their younger days, which used to be full of dreams.

As part of its efforts to materialize the ‘Post-Museum’ vision, SeMA is opening the Project Gallery as a space for alternative and experimental contemporary art and holding Video Fever: Screening, Live Performance and Talk, organized by the Media Collection of SeMA, to commemorate the new gallery’s opening, between July 30 and September 1, 2013. Video Fever: Screening, Live Performance and Talk will present the familiar medium of videos, which were introduced as a mass media vehicle in the ‘40s and ’50s, and have been widely used in various fields of our daily life. Videos only began to be established as an independent art genre in the late 1960s. Compared to traditional media, video art depends more on technology, and has been developed into various formats along with the development of technology. This program generally introduces video art and its development by screening the single channel videos of the four world-famous artists and it aims to widen viewers’ understanding of video art.   For the screening, four video works are selected among the media collection of SeMA ‘Point of View: An Anthology of the Moving Image’(2003) which contains the works of the eleven world-famous video artists as well as interviews on the process of video art production. The program presents single channel video works by a number of artists including Gary Hill, who investigates videos as a new form of writing in the relationship between words and electronic images; Joan Jonas, who chooses videos as a means of expressing her performance; Pipilotti Rist, who raises questions about sex, the female body, and gender differences in modern society through aerial music and the installation of projected images; and Isaac Julien, whose work as a performative documentary tells stories about self-identity (black and gay) and creates a new space via multi-screen projections. Along with the showing of the single channel videos, interviews with internationally known curators Dan Cameron and Hans Ulich Obrist will be presented in order to assist visitors’ understanding of the artists and their works. With the works and the interviews, there will be additional programs prepared such as live performances of emerging artists and talks on video art in order to examine the meaning and influence of video art in the context of contemporary art.   <Live Performance> 6pm Tue 30th July  / 6pm Sun 18th August  Site-Specific, Uh 800/40  <Talk> 4pm Wed 7th August  From Video Art to Expanded Cinema ?

With the opening of SeMA Blue: 12 Events for 12 Rooms, which was a youth group exhibition held in April 2012, SeMA Gold 2012_Hidden Tracks, which revealed the hidden ambitions of nineteen veteran artists, ended in great success.  After the group exhibitions of youth and veteran artists, the SeMA Green Exhibition will focus on the art world of top artists who left behind great achievements in Korean art before and after the Korean War. One artist who is opening the door of the SeMA Green exhibition for the first time is Kim Ku-lim, a first-generation avant garde artist who remains tirelessly committed to creative activity even today.   Artist Kim Ku-lim was born in Sangju, Gyeongsangbuk-do in 1936. He did not have any formal art education, but has led the activities of such groups as Painting 68, A.G. Group, and the 4th Group, leaving important footsteps in the history of Korean avant garde art by developing his own unique artistic style. In addition, he carried out genre-transcending creative activities that created huge reverberations in the Korean art arena during the 1960-70s, focusing on painting and sculpture as well as happenings, installation art, mail art, body painting, land art, and experimental movies.  The exhibition titled SeMA Green Kim Ku-lim: Like You Know It All will show some experimental artworks by artist Kim Ku-lim from the 1960s and ’70s. After the presentation, some lost artworks, as well as works which exist only in the form of ‘esquisses’  and could not be realized due to technological problems or realistic limitations, will be exhibited. In particular, Korea’s first experimental movie, The Meaning of 1/24 Sec, will be restored and presented in a 16mm format. It was produced in 1969, but the original copy was lost after its first screening at the National Museum of Contemporary Art in 2000. Korea’s first electric artwork, titled Space Construction, which was produced in 1968 but lost after the Art Exhibition of 11 Korean Artists held in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, as well as a large installation artwork titled From Phenomenon to Traces D, which was forcibly pulled down by the organizer even though it had been invited by the National Museum of Contemporary Art in 1970, will be exhibited as well.

Paul Gauguin was a leading Post-Impressionist artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. His artistic style led directly to the Synthetist style of modern art and also influential to Fauvism, German Expressionism, Cubism, and Abstract Paintings in the 20th century art. In the 21st century, still remains the Paul Gauguin’s artistic heritage in contemporary art.   SeMA explored the spirituality of Gauguin works in 'Voyage into the Myth' as well as his historic-stylistic achievement in his art. Linking and harmonizing the 21st century contemporary art with Gauguin’s masterpieces, this exhibition will offer an interesting opportunity to experience various meanings of “Paradise” in contemporary art after Gauguin. The works produced by Marco Brambilla and five other contemporary artists visually interrupt the flow of Gauguin artworks and vigorously generate the senses of radical vision and symbolic logic, the same artistic virtues found in Gauguin artworks.  60 Gauguin artworks including Gauguin’s tri-masterpieces, 'Yellow Christ' 'Vision After the Sermon' 'Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?' have rarely been shown altogether in public throughout the world. 'Gauguin and After: Voyage into the Myth' will give audiences a breathtaking experience to meet the powerful Gauguin masterpieces.

Sunday, 2:00pm - 6:00pm",,"paintings, video, performance, installation (sound, media) ",14 works,,,"'In all fictional works, each time a man is confronted with several alternatives, he chooses one and eliminates the others; in the fiction of Ts'ui P?n, he chooses― simultaneously―all of them. He creates, in this way, diverse futures, diverse times which themselves also proliferate and fork. …'  (Jorge Luis Borges (1941), from The Garden of Forking Paths)    This exhibition began from two points that are unrelated to each other. The unique composition of the gallery, which is part of the SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY (SNR), has become in itself the format of this exhibition. The gallery used to be a wastewater processing facility, but it was renovated into an empty space upon the construction of SNR. The space consists of two independent circular spaces, forming a pair of near-perfect symmetrical spaces. Such symmetrical structures provide the first clue about the exhibition. They were designed so as to co-exist without hierarchy or to contradict each other. The name of the exhibition, The Roads of Forking Paths, which instantly reminds people of a concrete scene, was adopted from the title of a well-known short story, The Garden of Forking Paths, written in 1941 by Jorge Luis Borges. In this story, Borges suggests a multi-layered time structure which encompasses all possibilities. The artists participating in this exhibition planned a pair of symmetrical artworks that contradict each other, or repeat themselves, or run parallel to each other, or complement or conflict with each other, or are dislocated or multi-faceted, or are disintegrated or co-exist. Here, parallelism does not simply pursue a formative parallel, but refers to two possibilities of the same weight which are separated from one thought. Through this process, the artists decided to support a format and content that are related to each other or run away from each other as they embrace the possibility of errors which may evade perfect rationality.   Under a given situation, viewers should understand the exhibition as they actively visit the two spaces. However, it is impossible for them to see the two spaces as a whole due to the characteristics of the space, so they can only see a disconnected, fragmented view. An integration of such views occurs in the brains of the viewers in different time lags. It is similar to presenting two sides of a coin which cannot be seen simultaneously, but it allows viewers to actively derive all possible conclusions. Through this, different times evolve simultaneously like parallel universes which exist in different dimensions within the same time zone.   We are all aware of the unavoidable boredom we may experience in the midst of an easygoing, comfortable life. This exhibition presupposes that experiences with discord and enmity, which evolve from the intermixture of dissimilar elements, can move our thoughts to an area where things of the past have not been realized. Such discord or multiplicity could be one of the basic conditions that prevents our life escaping the magnetic field of discord, absorption or dislocation owing to the expansion of modernity, even though we live in the 21st century.   The artists participating in this exhibition support the notions of ambivalence, compatibility, contradiction, and conflict. When our life accelerates along a straight line, we often imagine other lines which do not easily harmonize as they exist in the margins or below or above. Within a tight net of time which disperses, converges or goes parallel, the lines divide into two parts limitlessly. At this exhibition, two circular spaces, which are symmetrical, tie two forces running in separate directions into a single tension, and they become a place which mediates simultaneous forces stretching out in four directions unnoticeably. Moving to a different location will depend on the viewer's free will. ■ Kim Ayoung  ",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192842_f01e71d9343c468a8ce7b08248f1a40d_3f8ae819b5154f448bd363f5f83aac93,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=293,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Artists Bang & Lee, Wonwoo Lee, and Mihye Cha, who are in the SeMA NANJI RESIDENCY, reflect the process of their development, including the connection and disconnection of dialogues, in their artworks. Their artworks, which seem to talk to each other and tell stories in a somewhat whispered words or which have a disjunctive message, intermix with each other. They leave the point where artworks naturally interconnect, like a link, open. These artists tell stories after going through the process of discussing and exchanging their thoughts. Dialogues reflect mutual communion that takes place between more than two people. The exhibition hall is divided into two sections. One presents artworks that are based on the works related to narratives while the other shows new pieces that interpret their stories through the process of dialogue. When we think on discussions about what dialogue is as a starting point of dialogues, this exhibition will show traces of dialogues held between the participating artists. This exhibition, which has the characteristics of improvisation, happening, and variable dimensions, reorganizes the artworks selected for this exhibition into the mode of dialogue between the participating artists. It re-establishes the relationship between the recorded dialogues and disappearing dialogues, or the relationship between the dialogues to be remembered or forgotten. The work in process will become some other more experimental project for dialogue and open up new possibility of production.   ■ Bang & Lee  <br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>opening reception : 2013. 5. 1 (Wed) 5pm",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2F2016%2Fmgimg%2Fimg31%2Feng%2F&FILE_NM=pfile2016_1468459123093.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835192,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Focusing on the Korean Japanese Artists in 2013 as part of the Nationwide Municipal Museums of Art Network project, which was planned during the 1st meeting with the directors of municipal museums of art in response to the need for various exchange projects and exhibitions to strengthen the functions of public museums of art. As part of the first project, eight museums of art, including the Seoul Museum of Art, will hold special exhibition tours. This exhibition will evoke fruitful interpretations of the Ha Jung-woong collection, which belongs to five municipal museums, including the Gwangju Museum of Art, by allowing each museum to reorganize their exhibition. This project is largely based on exchange and collaboration between the various museums of the network, and has great significance in that it aims to open up communication between the researchers of the museums. This network project will help re-establish the role and status of public museums of art and exercise considerable influence on the construction of infrastructure, including the re-organization of the museum system and the professional workforce. This project will be carried out every year. As part of another project of the network, the Jeonbuk Museum of Art is planning to hold New & Now: SeMA’s New Acquisitions 2012, an exhibition of the Seoul Museum of Art’s new collection of installation works and sculptures, in May.  The first special exhibition tour is to be held at the Seoul Museum of Art  Progressive Art in the Turbulent Era ? Focusing on the Korean Japanese Artists   The Seoul Museum of Art's exhibition titled Special Exhibition of Ha Jung-woong Collection “Art of Prayers” will show aspects of the early modern and contemporary history of Korea and Japan from the perspectives of both Korean-Japanese and Japanese artists. The exhibition will be held for 27 days under the title Progressive Art in the Turbulent Era ? Focusing on the Korean Japanese Artists. In relation with this exhibition, seminars will be held on May 15 (Wed) at the SeMA Hall under such titles as ‘Exploring New Directions for the Network Project’; ‘The Use of the Collections of Museums of Art’; and ‘The Value and Significance of the Ha Jung-woong Collection’. The exhibition has been conceived to shed light on Korean-Japanese artists who have generally been neglected in the history of Korean and Japanese art. It will focus on works of realism, excluding mono paintings, and take a look at life during the historically turbulent period from the viewpoint of ethnic minorities, and particularly that of Japanese artists and Korean-Japanese artists. The Ha Jung-woong collection, which is possessed collectively by the Gwangju, Busan, Daejeon, Pohang, and Jeonbuk Museums of Art, mainly consists of works which emphasize the social participatory function of art. His collection will provide a great opportunity for visitors to see the memorable heritage of that time through works left by Japanese artists who had sound awareness of history, as well as artists of the Korean diaspora during that period.   Traces of History, Legacy of Memories  The exhibition titled Progressive Art in the Turbulent Era to be held at the Seoul Museum of Art will present some 100 works by 11 artists selected from among the works of the Ha Jung-woong collection belonging to the Gwangju Museum of Art. It consists of two sections. The first section, Traces of History, will consist of works that record and report aspects of human life during the early modern and contemporary history of Korea and Japan; while the second section, Legacy of Memories, will highlight the social function of art from the perspectives of ethnic minorities (including Koreans) that live in Japan. Traces of History, which are footsteps left behind by human life, influence our present consciousness as a heritage of abiding memories rather than disappearing among our buried memories. The themes and contents of the works are inseparable from the main issues of human life.  By exhibiting works by Japanese artists and Korean-Japanese artists who lived through a turbulent period of history, this exhibition will provide an opportunity for visitors to see a different viewpoint of the time shared by Japanese artists and Korean-Japanese artists, which characterizes the Ha Jung-woong collection. The first section, Traces of History, consists of photos of the dancer Choi Seung-Hee; Hanaoka Story, a collaborative work by three Japanese artists, namely, Nii Hiroharu, Takidaira Jiro, and Maki Daisuke; and lithographic works by Tomiyama Taeko. The second section, Legacy of Memories, exhibits works by Kwak Duck-jun, Kim In-sook, Song Young-ok, Chun Hwa-hwang, and Cho Yang-gyu, who portrayed the life of that time from realistic trends. Visitors to the exhibition will be able to see how artists strove to offer a window into their own era, and implicitly expressed the politics, economy, society, and culture of the time in their works.

835186,181,2013 NANJI ART SHOWⅠ : Mnemosyne's Privacy,,SeMA Nanji Residency,2013-04-10,2013-04-21,http://semananji.seoul.go.kr/english/program/exhibition_list.jsp ,,,2pm-6pm (closed on mondays),,multi-media,0,"Kim Byung-kwan, Suh Dong-wook, Cha Mihye, Choi Hyo-min",,"Invitation from Mnemosyne : Something which fills the empty body, flows deep, and reaches a invisible vague space-Aletheia, to gaze the secret of object, and event of stillness  Have you ever been deluded by quiet fall of waterdrops, secret walk of light, wavering of leaves when it meets wind, or empty body of you, anyone, or anything placed in the ruins or emptiness ... any of such small and silent daily things, or illusion of it. When such small things linger, they sometimes hold our hurried steps and stimulate our dull eyes.  Isn't the movement of stillness possessed by the things, or abundant boredom time wraps with layers a soft summons to call isolated body and forgotten senses? At the moment when you are enticed by something, a special relationship between you and the object is formed, and the first memories which have never been recalled will come to you taking off their veils.  The return of Mnemosyne, one of the Titans in the Greek mythology, and goddess of memory the abstract concept of memory is personified, starts here. Contrary to water of Lethe, the river of forgetfulness, water of Mnemosyne has the power of reminding one of everything concealed. As Martin Heidegger said, Isn't Aletheia, which means truth in ancient Greek, so-called A-letheia which recalls what are forgotten? Here the memory is not simply recalling of the time one has passed through in one's life, but may be similar to concentration of thinking on the time-space one has not yet encountered. He also named the situation spigel-spiel(mirror-play) in which the heaven, the earth, the divine, and what will be mortal reflect each other in das Gevierte(the Four-Fold). It too means looking at, or facing each other which recovers forgotten Being.  What is prompted in such a game is a feast of poetic language where there are the expressions of Being and pure answers to them. Being meets with the moment when concealed worlds unveil themselves. Mnemosyne is known to be the mother of nine Muses who give inspiration. Thus, are all the people who live as artists descendents of memory, or small children of the Muses? Around here, it seems proper to recall the alluring and fascinating proclamation Jean-Luc Nancy disclosed in his book 『Les Muses』. He says that the art is trace, vestige, and 'unavoidably vague things (...) where there are only proliferation of what are seen, and various flashes of the visible and the emotional ... which cannot be returned to anything ... ,' and, in the end, 'infinite finitness. ' If all the arts can be called as examples of vestiges which reveal the accumulation of memories, they must be gifts from Mnemosyne. At the empty shell of snail, To encounter Mnemosyne's children-Maybe it was late autumn when I came here that I began to think often of Mnemosyne. A humble and remote island which received silently what were discarded by the metropolitan city in the past. Ironically, the name of the island is NanJi(난지(蘭芝), Orchid and Scent Grass). Over time, the ruins have become the place of cozy living space and clean workplace, and a resting place where fragrant plants grow. And, at a corner of the island, a good studio for artists came into being. The two round settling tanks where dirty water was purified in the past were reborn as two exhibition halls. The space, which keeps the traces of the past, retaining 'Kyeo(켜, time-based layers)' and 'Gyeol(결, space-based textures)' of the past and reminds one of the past, might be the waiting place and platform where artists dream of meeting their 'mothers' again.  Round exhibition halls which were covered with white snow, and in deep hibernation were beautiful because they were humble. One day, the halls were reminiscent of the image of deep and quiet spiral forms like empty shells of snail. I was wondering for a long time, 'Isn't an empty shell of snail a secret room or a labyrinth for Mnemosyne, goddess of memory?' Around the time when snow began to melt down in spring light, I happened to meet some friends, resident artists and experienced the enticing moment of glimpsing at the images they created. And, we would invite each other knocking at the snail shells, and were excited in the expectation of making private spaces where Mnemosyne of each of us would stay.  My friends were nice and delicate, and seemed to love the tranquility among occasional wits without reason (or with reason). In a moment, were we attracted to illusory image and compulsion made by Kim Byung-kwan, and did we share the fatal addiction in the prison of jouissance we could not reach? Occasionally, there was happiness of touching what seemed to be the origin of those I could not understand, while I were trembling at the cool sensuality and vague silence images of Suh Dong-wook provide me with. Other times, I, like wounded birds, hided for several days in the deep and faint eyesight by Cha Mihye who caught the silent accident soaked into objects in the empty place. And, while listening to their stories, I also would imagine dancing of bodies which were searching for their memories in the opening of unbarred empty time-space.  Somtimes, watching art pieces, I would guess the time the artists must have spent alone, or deep solitude they fell into to create the pieces. I would imagine the innumerable days filmmakers, with their one-eyed friends (cameras), might have spent watching and waiting for the fluttering of wings of butterflies and whispering of wind for a long time; painters must have spent accumulating layers of tremor and time in numerous strokes of brush like sensitive tentacles; or animators may have wondered strange spaces creating realities in digital spaces where only electronic signals exist. Did ordinary language wander its boundary and slip away from the network of meanings in the 'waiting' of each artist which is not opened or closed? Meanwhile, they, no, we, breathing deep breath, may have come across the moment of A-letheia which makes unlimited differences beyond the visible.  Now, we have been able to fill the empty shells of snail, and invite strange friends in the secret room and labyrinths for Mnemosyne. As the pieces of artists faced one another, my humble idea made the secret piece for the piano by Erik Satie, a French modern composer, into an installation art. The fact that it changed into a joint performance where all the artists would participate in will be a memorable event in the future. Like a Holderlin's poem introduced at the beginning of this writing, 'memory', 'a meaningless signal,' is waiting for you who will wait for a long time for a flash moment to see the truth. Will you accept 'Her' invitation? Layers of time in empty space pass away.

The four of us have never met before coming to SNR and have worked separately on individual projects during our time here. The title 'Exquisite Corpse' is also the name of a drawing game, where the participants start on one drawing each. They then fold the paper and pass it over to the next person who continues the drawing without being able to see the part of the drawing that the previous drawer made. In this way, random combinations of visual elements are Compiled into units with sometimes absurd and beautiful results. As the show will be one of chance encounters between different visual elements and styles, we decided to title it after the game 'Exquisite Corpse'.  Making in a show together under these circumstances is a challenge ? but an interesting one. We therefore decided to build the theme around randomness and chance encounters between four very different projects and bodies of work. The plan is to embrace this randomness and use it in order to create interesting or absurd contrasts and harmonies. The objective is also to play around with the exhibition space and our works within it, making the installation process a collaborative creative process.  ■ SeungYul Oh_Jamila Drott_Marco Pezzotta_Adrian Gamietea  The surround around where I go in Seoul with my wondering eyes spotting things that are not significant, more likely abandoned or pointless. It may be rather finding poignant from mundane. The empathy on these elements had been gathered together in various ways with an exaggeration to give its existence and physicality. It is to emphasize and signify that which accustomed to or ignored. It approaches with familiar but strange, seen and unseen, pull and push, in and out, real and unreal, inflate and deflate, full and empty, small and big, and tangible and intangible. It is an experience of coexistence on a fine line in between these opposite possibilities to pull and push its directions.  ■ SeungYul Oh  In recent years I have worked with painting and sculpture verging on performance art. The object is still at the core of the work, but extra emphasis lies on the creative ritual, and the temporality of the process. I often use existing environments where I allow materials and objects to deviate from their intended functions, and become communicators of new meanings. Restructuring my surroundings, I make selected parts more communicative or have them tell different stories than what they normally do. Essential to my work is negotiation of space, where individuals go against the structures of public space creating new patterns, contributing to the constant state of change in our physical world. I use these processes in my work, both as sites of intervention and as methods to structure my own creative process. Presently I'm working with painting and sculpture, experimenting with forms of documentation as the work proceeds.  ■ Jamila Drott  Basically I believe that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, so I try to force things together and watch them re-shaping after their new context. A narrative process is the easiest way to do that. There, you get something from nothing. During my stay at Nanji I focused on the official side of collective narrative. It is meant to be the public way of telling history, and regularly it is a pointless attempt to keep a unique version of facts. I worked on monumental aesthetic and material, willing to deprive it from references, and using it as a weak pedestal for vague images of a whatever memory.  ■ Marco Pezzotta  I make reference to the city-architecture binomial, automatically focusing on technical drawing, though this does not stand entirely on its own, as it is often accompanied by pictorial aspects. I employ paper as support, as well as pens and pencils, to guarantee a more structural focus; all the while using oil paint with the objective of diminishing the frontier between painting and drawing. I must emphasize that paper, pencil and pen are the materials that are most sought after by drawers, the same way that oil paint is by painters. In my recent work, while attempting to expand the two-dimensional language, I resort to sculpture and installation too.  ■ Adrian Gamietea<br><p class='o_h1'>Event</p>opening reception: 5pm",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2F2016%2Fmgimg%2Fimg31%2Feng%2F&FILE_NM=pfile2016_1468461512533.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=835185,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

This year’s exhibition, the fifth such event, was planned in a new form in order to explore a new developmental direction based on previous accomplishments, which have succeeded instimulating discussion about contemporary art through artworks by young artists.   This exhibition will shed light on aspects of artworks by young contemporary artists who are actively working at home and overseas in various genres. Amid a situation where the boundaries of art itself, as well as the media and genres of art, have become blurred, this exhibition will provide an opportunity for visitors, artists, and the art museum to communicate with each other and appreciate a new flow of our art, by providing a space in which young artists can freely think and explore.   This exhibition of works by twelve young artists will encompass every field of modern art including painting, video, photography, installation art, and sound. The works on which the young artists are currently concentrating are the theme of this exhibition. Accordingly, twelve events, which will be held in twelve rooms, will show the current direction of each young artist, and the exhibitions displayed in twelve rooms become one connected exhibition revealing diverse aspects of Korean modern art as created by young contemporary artists. The twelve rooms of the twelve artists are each successively connected with each other while serving as twelve independent stages on which a unique artistic incident occurs, and each room serves as a scene to form one big stage within the topology of contemporary art.  The new form adopted by this exhibition is designed to shed light on artworks by young artists through its open composition. It will serve as a venue which generates points of discussion about contemporary art, as well as future development, by enhancing the public’s understanding and appreciation of the meaning and diversity of modern art.  Viewing Points: A simultaneous presentation of twelve exhibition rooms and twelve events showing aspects of the art world of young contemporary artists.

The 17th Invitational Exhibition by the Seoul Intangible Heritage Preservation Society, to celebrate its opening.  This event celebrating the opening of the Living Arts Museum consists of two categories, traditional handicrafts such as lacquerware, onggi (brown-glazed pottery) making, decorative knot making, needlework, and wood furniture making, and traditional alcoholic beverages representing the cultural heritage of Seoul. The event is participated by 23 masters of Seoul’s intangible heritage who have committed their lives to the preservation and development of the traditional culture. The fine works of living arts displayed in this event are expected to provide viewers with a rare opportunity to experience remarkable talents of great artists and some of the essential features of Korean traditional culture.  This exhibition is aimed to guide the art-loving public to that the traditional craftworks displayed here are not just relics of the past but practical works of art taking roots in the daily life of modern people. That is why the museum introduced new ideas and techniques of modern design to the way the objects are exhibited.  Living Arts Museum will continued to present exhibitions of living arts, which include handicraft, design, fashion and architecture, and grow into one of the Korea’s top institution of its kind according to the strategy “to create local cultural hubs and specialized spaces.” The SeMA plans to turn its affiliates into local cultural hubs committed to specialized themes. According to the plan, the SeMA’s Main Hall in Seosomun will be grown into a center of global cultural networking, the Nam Seoul Museum of Art into a main stage for handicrafts and design related with our everyday life, and Buk Seoul Museum of Art into a public art complex friendly to the local community. This spatial specialization effort is expected to help the SeMA better adapted to the tendency of modern art moving towards expanding the boundary of art and trying to meet diverse demands from various rungs of society.  The organizer hopes that this opening show of the Living Arts Museum will play an important role in the SeMA’s effort to grow further via continuing to present exciting exhibitions of handicrafts, design, fashion, and architecture.

Museum’s collection is a fundamental factor, which not only establishes the identity of the museum, but also functions as a medium of communication between viewers and art institutions. To strengthen such meaning and enhance the quality of SeMA, we adopted a new collecting policy, beginning from last year. This new policy aims to maintain balance of the collection by medium, genre and period, while at the same time building a comprehensive and characteristic collection which would differentiate us from other institutions.    To meet this goal, we have acquired a total of 198 pieces over two times last year. In order to keep balance between genres, proportions of (public) sculpture, installation, media works have been increased and important pieces in art history were partially added to the list. Also, with the aim of emphasizing contemporary characteristic of art, inspiring the will to create, and setting up an upright art market, we focused on living artists in the field, especially those who are domestically and internationally active, instead of those who passed away.   < New & Now : New Acquisitions 2012 : > is composed of 39 sculptures and installations taken from our last year’s acquisition. In order to overcome the spatial limitation of the exhibition hall on the 1st floor, we confined our selections to 3 dimensional pieces. However, as we have concentrated on two specific genres, sculpture and installation, we expect this to work as an opportunity in magnifying the aesthetical inspiration for the viewers. Paintings and media works that are not displayed in this exhibition will be presented at our next special exhibition for the opening of SeMA Buk Seoul, which is planned for July this year.   Museum’s collection has its meaning in influence and educational effect it delivers to the viewers, as opposed to mere asset value of the artworks. It is in this respect that we may appraise the special value of exhibitions featuring museum’s collection, which intermediates between artworks and viewers. Especially, as it is implied by the title <New & Now>, this exhibition declares a new beginning of SeMA’s collection, sending the message of SeMA’s will to communicate with its viewers, and to spread and share ongoing contemporary art.   Furthermore, SeMA is seeking to start its practice of display, education and promotion anew. To break from existing customs and the rigid system of museums, and to become a social museum paying attention to the public, viewers, citizens and community, as well as a multi-functional museum that places emphasis on fusion and convergence instead of a single value, we are developing various programs in accordance with our vision to become a ‘post-museum’.

The contemporary artists included in this collection have been highly active in numerous fields of art including calligraphy, design, and fine art etc. This exhibition explores the changing aspects of contemporary Hangeul through the work of artists with unique work styles and perspectives.   Regardless of the medium, this exhibition is comprised of three sections each looking at the development of Hangeul since its inception, from the age of paper and pen to the digital age. The first section <Hangeul as Art> exhibits work transformed from the unique shape of Hangeul. The second section <Hangeul as Inspiration> introduces Hangeul as a raw material of creation. The last section <Hangeul as Interaction> presents art inspired by the principle of Hangeul and its invention. As a whole, the work demonstrates the ways in which modern times might accommodate Hangeul ? as a sound, as a form, and as a meaning.  The first section <Hangeul as Art>on the first floor outlines the beauty of Hangeul based on its raw materials ? the sky, the earth, the humans ? through the unique work of the calligrapher and the graphic designer. On the second floor, the second section <Hangeul as Inspiration>examines the beauty of Hangeul as characters and its structural formation through investigation and an experimental approach; this allows us to witness the harmony between the calligrapher, graphic designer, and dancer. As a result, by combining body, costume, and poetry, the second section transforms the various figures of Hangeul in its present age into an art. The last section <Hangeul as Interaction> foregrounds the personality of Hangeul as sound equaling image and allows the opportunity to witness the beauty of this alphabet due to its aesthetics and scientific principles.    The exhibition is made through the interaction of artists with diverse backgrounds; it enables us to experience the beautiful variations and to broaden our understanding of Hangeul. We hope this exhibition highlights the aesthetic sense of Hangeul’s past and present, and also provides creative direction for the future of Korean art.

The term “Art Archives” refers to materials with lasting and permanent value among the record materials, which have been collected or created by art-related agencies. As the year 2012 is the 10th anniversary year of the opening of the Seoul Museum of Art at the former location of the Supreme Court, this exhibition brings great meaning in that it shows the museum’s intention of constructing archives. The title of this exhibition was named “2012 SeMA Archive: Looking Back and Forward”, because it will provide an opportunity for visitors to see and understand the intrinsic characteristics of archives. The exhibition “2012 SeMA Archives: Looking Back and Forward” consists of materials related to artists who have participated in SeMA exhibitions, particularly two representative exhibitions of this year held by the Seoul Museum of Art: “SeMA Youth 2012: 12 Events for 12 Rooms” and “SeMA Gold 2012_Hidden Tracks.” The portfolios of artists contain artists’ vita, notes, and records about the concept of their artworks, artwork-related images, critiques or artists’ own writings, which show the art world of each artist. In addition, original sketches and drawings, as well as catalogs and videos about individual and group exhibitions, are on display for visitors to see the process of art creation of each artist in a single viewing. History is not preserved on its own. The history of art museums is somewhat the same. Human memory has limitations in remembering all the fine exhibitions and educational programs that have been offered for the public. This exhibition is held to preserve such history, which might otherwise disappear from our memories, and the elements of such history that lie in artworks and artists. Another objective of this exhibition is to provide a foundation for constructing a systematic archive system. This is a public declaration, announcing that the construction of archives will be an ongoing activity beyond just a one-time effort.

The exhibition will showcase new media artworks in which various genres such as architecture, media, and sound are realized. The exhibition will serve as a venue for overseas artists based in the UK, Belgium, Japan, Australia, and India, as well as for five Korean artists to present their new works under the theme of ‘Artificial Garden’.  Notably, this exhibition will present early photos and nineteen drawings by Haus-Rucker-Co., widely recognized as a pioneer of avant-garde architecture in the 20th century, together with Archigram, for the first time in Korea. Haus-Rucker-Co was founded by the artist Klaus Pinter and architects G?nter Zamp Kelp and Laurids Ortner. It does not limit the scope or activities of its works, which range from architectural design to performance art, to a particular medium or form. Furthermore, it endeavors to actively disseminate the concept of ‘temporary architecture’ or ‘disposable architecture’, which predicts changes in the environment early on. Forest (2012) by Indian artist Ranbir Kaleka shows fancy time and space that transcend reality based on the odd characteristics of the combined media of painting and video, but the plot of the art consists in reporting reality, mainly focusing on existential problems such as the problems of migratory workers or the life of Indians, from the perspective of the artist’s own experiences.   Media artist Yangachi creates artworks that decipher the political, economic, and cultural codes of the digital environment and network systems of the past ten years. Currently, he is planning to present <A Gathering of Testicular Cancer Patients> (2012), which is an installation and performance work based on storytelling practices.   Garden in the Air (2012) is a sound art installation work by KWON Byungjun, who is well known for his indie band activities such as “Pippie Long Stocking” or “Wonder Bird”. It is a real-time work of art in which programmed sound is performed through sixteen speaker channels by a light sensor. This work of art is completed by elements that vary depending on time and space, such as space, sound, and light.  Light Tree (2011) is a work of interactive media art by HYBE (Han Changmin, RyuSunwoong), who won an award at the Da Vinci Ideas Competition of Seoul Art Space GEUMCHEON. It will be exhibited together with Floating Garden (2012), which is an installation structure designed by architect and Professor Kook Hyoung-gul (Ewha Womans University). Professor SeoHyojung (sadi) is a first-generation new media artist who is still working actively. During this exhibition, she will present her works of art, which were created as part of a project to assist the recovery from earthquake damage in Japan.   Japanese media artist Taka Hiro Matsuo, Belgium’s famous media art group LAb [au], and the UK’s sound designer and media artist Sophie Clements will also present works based on ‘dreamy’ light and sound that respond to the movements of visitors.

274,167,Joo Myung Duck: the beginning and another beginning,,Nam Seoul Museum of Art,2012-10-10,2012-11-25,,,,,,Photos,100 pieces,,,"The exhibition titled Joo Myung Duck: the beginning and another beginning will be held to commemorate the donation of works of art by Joo Myung Duck (1940~ ), a master of Korean photography, and to shed light on his creative world. The Seoul Museum of Art received a donation of 76 artworks in 2011 directly from the artist, who is perceived as a living witness of Korean photography. For this exhibition, the museum has selected fifty pieces from his first documentary photo series, titled “The Mixed Names”, as well as fifty pieces from the artist’s collection.   Retrospective exhibitions are usually held for veteran artists who have dedicated their entire life to creating art. However, this exhibition will display artworks from a series of documentary photos from the 1960s, when the artist took his first steps as an artist, as well as a series titled “The Abstract in Photography”, which is an ongoing project. This exhibition will attempt to show how artist Joo Myung Duck’s caring vision of the world has been realized and how it has changed from the beginning of his career to the present.    This exhibition will comprise five sections, namely, “1966 The Mixed Names”, “1968 Yongjugol”, “1971 Uncheon”, “1963~68 Seoul” , and “2011~2012 The Abstract in Photography”, in order to show the landscapes of places captured by the eyes of the artist.  The sections titled “1966 The Mixed Names”, “1968 Yongjugol”, and “1971 Uncheon” feature different places from different times, but they all use the Korean War, one of the most painful chapters in Korea’s history, as the background.  The section “The Mixed Names” is a series of documentary photos produced around 1966. This series contains photos of abandoned mixed-race orphans, who were conceived by foreign soldiers fighting in the Korean War and Korean women. It has great significance in that it was Joo Myung Duck’s first work to concentrate on realism in his career. Through these artworks, the artist raised social issues related to mixed-race orphans who, by 1966, had been neglected for fifteen years, based on the facts and records contained in the artist’s photos. In his subsequent series of artworks, such as “1968 Yongjugol” and “1971 Uncheon”, Joo continued to express issues concerning mixed-race orphans, recording them in photos during his visits to US Army bases, which were symbols of the divided nation.  The series “1963~68 Seoul” consists of works which record certain social aspects of that time, primarily by capturing daily scenes as they were happening in various corners of Seoul in the 1960s. The scenes captured by the “caring eyes” of the artist succeed in depicting the sensibility and personal stories of the characters in his photos, and as such are much more than mere objective photographic records.  His recent series, titled “2011~2012 The Abstract in Photography”, consistent with his early works, contain daily scenes captured from the contemplative stance of an onlooker. The subjects featured in the series “The Abstract in Photography”, which remind people of artworks of abstract expressionist or post-painterly abstraction, include the sea and sky seen through windows; fences covered with graffiti; traffic lanes; and old cracked and chipped painted walls. These trivial scenes, which we can easily see all around us, were closely captured in time and space by the artist, and transformed into abstract forms which no longer contain concrete stories.  These scenes, which capture the vicissitudes in the lives of ordinary people who went through difficult times in the past, or others which suggest the dark side of society, used to draw out instantaneous sympathy, but now they have been transformed into scenes that induce limitless thoughts without suggesting or coercing anything.

Participating artists have been chosen from among the artists the Seoul Museum of Art has so far supported and who have taken note of the problem with images, that is, visibility. The exhibition aims to showcase the dynamism and diversity of contemporary art.   As the media environment becomes more diversified, people live in a flood of images, produced and consumed, that seem more real than reality. In today’s society dominated by images, everyone has the experience of perceiving the image per se as reality, through its continuous reproduction. While able to sense the gap between what we see and what we know, between images and reality, we live without appreciating this. This show intends to examine aspects of contemporary art that will make viewers aware of this gap through the works of rising artists. Like a mirror reflecting objects rather than seeing them as the subject, our eyes react to images. As an illusion, a painting transferring an object to a two-dimensional surface is based on the premise that it deceives the viewer’s eye.   Part 1, The Strange Mirror: Chasm between Images and eye presents artworks that engender visual effects through the use of various devices, and experiment with new dimensions of illusion in a playful manner. This section introduces work that generates optical illusions by employing a variety of mediums such as video, photography, and electronic devices. Part 2, Treachery of Images: Chasm between Images and reality poses questions concerning our imperfect perceptual system, the social system’s influence on this, and the relationship between the visible and invisible through works revealing the chasm between what we know and what we see, imagery and reality. These works clarify that an act of seeing or the imagery itself is coded, discovering a variety of desires and contradictions derived from coded images.   The show intends to shed light on various issues related to images such as reality and imagination, individual and system, and representation and entity. Along with this the museum has planned the Chronology Project, Interview Project, and Research Project with participating artists to get a sense of young artists’ thoughts and anxieties in our age, and to have an opportunity to stimulate communication between the museum, artists, and viewers.   Part 1. The Strange Mirror: Chasm between Images and eye Participating Artists: Kim Min-Jeong, Noh Hae-Yul, Lee Joong-Keun, Cho Byung-wang, Jung Sang-Hyun, Kang Young-Min, Kim KI-Hoon, Lee Young-Min, Kang Yi-yun , Kim Yong-kwan Part 2.

Human anxiety continues due to natural disasters, diseases, accidents, and punishment. Paradoxically, modern societies are being maintained by such feelings of anxiety, therefore accordingly, a kind of catastrophe can be expected in the future of modern societies. Artists are people who have well-developed sensibilities rather than rationality, so they excel at sensing signs of catastrophe. They sense these signs early on and express them as art. Through artists’ artworks that show the origin of anxiety and the signs of catastrophe, visitors will be able to diagnose the diseases of the modern society and examine how such diseased phenomena can be dissolved in the process of catharsis through art.    ■ This exhibition is held as part of a cultural exchange between Korea and Japan. It will serve as an opportunity to revitalize cultural exchange between the two countries and to promote the globalization of the Nanji Residency, which is being operated by the Seoul Museum of Art.

263,163,Color Symphony,,Nam Seoul Museum of Art,2012-07-31,2012-08-26,,,,,,,,,,"The Seoul Museum of Art is holding an exhibition of its collection of abstract paintings at the Nam Seoul Museum of Art during the summer vacation. This exhibition concentrates on the beauty of abstract painting with a view to helping visitors develop a closer relationship with abstract painting, which can be perceived as obscure and difficult to understand due to the absence of concrete shapes on the painting. A long history of meaning has been accumulated since the beginnings of human culture, with specific colors representing similar emotions across disparate cultural areas, and acquiring contrasting meanings according to their local use. As the meaning of colors is strengthened or diversified depending on space and time, color has become a part of group unconsciousness and an important symbol of human life. Colors are directly connected to our deep unconsciousness, so we can communicate with each other intuitively, and the analysis and understanding of art works will follow naturally through the immediacy of shared feelings. Enjoying and accepting such an abundance of perceptual and psychological stimuli can be a meaningful way of appreciating works of art. We hope that this exhibition will further visitors’ understanding of the history of each one of these artworks, as well the artistic and social context in which they were created, through deep communion and close experience with them.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192839_7e44caabeba24269a33446be4c8db6c3_7c47a9503a5c4ec187139faf5c67d115,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=263,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

A ‘hidden track’ is a bonus song or piece of music included somewhere on a music album, without being included on the playlist of the album. The name came about because musicians often edit several bits of incomplete works and include them after the last track of their album with no title. The ‘hidden track’, which exists in an untitled form amid hit songs, new music, and completed songs, takes various forms such as a piece of unpublished music or noise, providing listeners with an opportunity to appreciate each musician’s unique sonic world. For musicians, a ‘hidden track’ provides a moment of fun, excitement, and freedom in the process of making a regular album, and at the same time gives an unexpected ‘surprise’ to the general public. I proposed these characteristics of the ‘hidden track’ to the nineteen veteran Korean artists participating in the SeMA Gold 2012 exhibition. Is there a way that we can prolong the art world of artists who are in their 50s and 60s and who have devoted themselves to the artist’s life for more than twenty or thirty years? How should we reflect on these artists’ long journey into their fully developed artistic world? How can we display their passion for art? And how do they react and respond to the current art situation? The exhibition Hidden Track is then the process by which our invited artists, all of whom are in their 50s and 60s, attempt to answer these and other similar questions. This exhibition will consist only of the ‘hidden tracks’ of veteran Korean artists, and will serve as an ‘unusual venue’ where the general public can appreciate these artists’ journey and passion, as well as their unique ideas. Amid the familiar works, well-known styles, and representative artworks of these artists, these ‘hidden tracks’ will create a special ‘moment’ for the general public, helping visitors to the exhibition to reflect on the works of these artists, who have been with us for more than 30 years.    Viewing Points  This exhibition consists of ‘hidden tracks’ by the participating artists. As such, it represents a new form of group exhibition which will create more fruitful narrative through unexpected conflicts and confrontations between the works on display.

252,160,Min Kyoung-kap _ Ask Nature the Way,,"Seoul Museum of Art, Nam Seoul Museum of Art Detailed View",2012-05-08,2012-07-08,,,,,,Korean Painting ,100-odd pieces (50 in Seoul Museum of Art / 50 in SeMA Nam Seoul),,,"The exhibition Min Kyoung-kap _ Ask Nature the Way aims to shed light on the art of Eusan Min Kyoung-kap (酉山 閔庚甲, 1933~) in commemoration of his donation of 36 pieces of works to the Seoul Museum of Art in 2009. A member of the National Academy of Arts, Min Kyoung-kap is a senior artist who has developed a distinctive style unparalleled in the realm of Korean painting.    For the past sixty-odd years, Artist Min Kyoung-kap has single-mindedly walked on the path of Korean painting and created a unique world of his own, combining the traditional features of 'Korean painting' with modernity that does away with the drab uniformity of previous 'Eastern painting.' When fine artists in Korea were actively engaged in group activities in search of breakthroughs in the early 1960's, Min co-founded the mugnimhoe (Black Ink Forest Society), an avant guard group unprecedented in Korean painting, and led the 'modernization' of Korean painting by introducing abstraction into the genre. As a young artist full of vigor, he was a major force behind the refreshing evolution of Korean painting, shattering the traditional conception of Eastern painting with daring visual experiments in style, such as nonrepresentational and semi-abstract paintings.   Since then, with Western painting growing by leaps and bounds, the artist began to wonder about the identity of Korean painting, namely, 'what can Korean painting offer that Western painting does not?' His lifelong quest to find answers to this question continues to this day. He saw that the path of Korean painting lies in expressing the sentiments and spirit of Koreans through Korean media, and this thought of his has been accompanied throughout his life by the theme of 'Nature.' Returning to representational paintings of realistic scenery in the early 1970's, the artist began to take nature as his main subject matter. His contemporary landscape painting with the theme of 'Nature' symbolized by 'the mountain' has been an ongoing process in which the portrayal of nature's outer appearance is transcended to capture the world of spirit that seeks oneness with nature. Under the overarching theme of 'Nature,' through a series of works such as 'In Harmony with Nature' in the 1980's to the early 1990's, 'Coexistence with Nature' in the mid to late 1990's, 'Into Nature' in the early 2000's, 'Non-Doing' in the 2000's, and 'True-Such' in the 2010's, the artist has endeavored to find the fundament of his artistic world and the spiritual archetype of Koreans in the attitude to seek harmony with 'the Way of Nature,' an invisible flow in which creations and dissolutions take place naturally and without any artificial technicality.  Artist Min Kyoung-kap has strengthened the characteristic features of Korean painting by holding on to the use of the traditional materials of hwaseonji (Korean painting paper), muk (black ink) and natural pigments, and by continuously pursuing the theme of 'Nature' in expressing the sentiments and spirit of Koreans who seek oneness with Nature. While carrying on the traditional features of Korean painting, he has created pictures with organic compositions, some in abstraction and others in representation, and has developed distinctive colors of Korean painting with clarity and depth that get beyond those of oil painting. Min is still on his ceaseless journey searching for the way of his art as a painter of Korean painting and for the identity of Korean painting, asking Nature the Way.

Appendix: Tarmac  <Introduction> (by the Earth from Above Organizing Committee in Korea) This special exhibition of The Earth from Above of Aerial photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand is comprised of 220 photographs and video images selected from those that the photographer has collected for more than 20 years. The photographs will make you feel as if you have been to outer space and become a mature citizen of a global village. Children will marvel at the beautiful and wonderful shapes of the Earth viewed from the sky, while senior citizens may be tempted to look back at their past, which is in some ways painful and some ways delightful. The event is prepared as a special feast for everyone who loves art, culture, and self-reflection. The photographer started the grand project The Earth from Above in 1993 with a passionate resolve for recording images of the Earth based on the thought that everything lacks transparency. However, he is still on the Earth. In October 2011, Yann was photographing the scenes of ideology-laden massacres of people, flying in the Congo sky, which has been filled with gun smoke for the past 40-plus years. Mother nature was displaying her wonderful sight regardless of what was going on between hostile people.   ? 1. The Earth from above ? The images of the Earth This is the first time that the photographer ever displayed his selected photographs in public. He is like an angel proposing that we change the paradigm of civilization in the 21st century from God’s perspective. 7 billion people on the Earth have their own life stories. He is like a bird with God’s perspective, overlooking delight, sorrow, or heartbreaking scenes occurring on the Earth.  -An exhibition that combines photography with criticism on civilization and a love of the Earth The exhibition is “special” in several respects. You will see how great each displayed piece is. There is no need for an explanation. What make this exhibition special is that the photographer shows everything about the world. He traveled to more than 130 countries in the world over 20-plus years and his photographs contain various scenes of the world. His photographs include documentary film-like photos; abstract painting-like photos, and even destroyed Buddha images in Bamiyan Cave, Afghanistan. You can say that his photographs are unique, as they show everything that can be expressed by art in one photo. Henri Cartier-Bresson was the master of fine art photography. Magnum Photographers are focusing on photo-journalism. Yann’s photographs combine fine art photography and photo-journalism into one, thus opening a new area of photographic art.  ? 2. The Korea from above ? Rediscovery of Korea Another factor that makes this event “special” is that it is a Korea-focused event. The Earth from Above Organizing Committee in Korea has worked together with Yann over the past 10 years. The exhibition was prepared by the Committee, including the planning and composition of the displayed items. The Committee made painstaking efforts to make the event a success, paying attention to every detail to ensure that every one of the displayed items is aligned to a level of understanding for both experts and lay people. It is also noteworthy that such meticulous preparations were made in collaboration with the photographer over an extended period of time under the supervision of former Cultural Minister Lee Eo-ryung. Mr. Lee Eo-ryung says that the exhibition is an artistic event that displays the conversion of the civilization paradigm in the 21st century like a harbinger. He wrote the foreword for The Korea from above and an essay for photographs of Korea included in the exhibition. The exhibition is “special,” as it is presented as an event containing storytelling. The event aims to share what the photographer saw with the people of the global village. In addition to seeking the most sublime form of art, the event invites visitors to a land of enticing storytelling. It is expected that visitors will have an interesting experience, feeling that the “there” contained in the 200-plus photographs is “here,” after all, and then “mine.” Even the contents of the event are Korean-specific. There are many uniquely beautiful things in Korea (you heard that Jeju Island was chosen as one of the New Seven Wonders of Nature by the New7Wonders foundation in Zurich, Switzerland, didn’t you?), but many of them remain unknown to foreigners. It will be a pleasant experience for visitors to look at the 30-plus aerial pictures of the country, selected from 20,000 photographs taken by the photographer over the past 6 years.  ? 3. HOME (Moving images of the DMZ in Korea opened for the first time)/ A film made by Yann Arthus-Bertrand   ? 4. Animals, other friends of ours/ Good Breeding/ Horse  - An opportunity to look at ourselves through livestock, humankind’s oldest friends Here, you will listen to the words exchanged between people and livestock, such as horses, cows, pigs, sheep, etc. They are duets of love and dialogue between people and livestock as contrasted with the culture of our times in which people treat animals harshly and treat other people like animals.  Livestock have been close friends with humankind. Animals, including those appearing on the Altamira Cave paintings and the Dangun Myth of Korea lived together with people. It is not an exaggeration to say that people created civilization with animals in the pre-industrialization era. Roman Empire and Ghengis Khan’s empire, for example, could not expand their sphere of influence without horses. Just as horses symbolized nomads, so cows symbolized farming settlers. With the advent of the industrialization era, animals turned from humankind’s everyday partners to those simply grown to meet people’s requirements. Pets are the opposite side of the foregoing story. The photographer has taken pictures of animals associated with humans over the past 20 years and animals play a crucial part in this exhibition. His photographs of animals are a wonder themselves. They are life hymns for animals. Perhaps, they are a declaration of animals’ rights. It is said that animals take after their master's characteristics. Yann’s photographs seem to confirm it. The photographs show that communication is carried out between the animals and humans. They seem to tell us what it is like to raise plants and animals (perhaps like raising children?) and what life is. Yann’s photographs let the Earth and animals have their say, and their voices made in unison will make visitors look at themselves.

The beauty of its unusual red-brick architecture and well-adorned garden attracts the attention of visitors to the gallery. This exhibition was planned to suggest an imaginary space to visitors who might have wondered, “What might be happening in here?” while standing in front of the building. As soon as visitors walk through the black steel gates and inside the gallery, they will enter into a new world that is quite different from reality. This unfamiliar Nam Seoul Annex Building has become a place that stimulates visitors’ curiosity ? it is a place full of imagination. The exhibition consists of four parts, which will allow visitors to form a sequential story depending on their viewing circulation: “Entering”, “Lingering”, “Being Lost”, and “Meeting.” Visitors will be able to experience mystical things where exhibits are on display, within several rooms that are arranged like a maze. This exhibition was specially planned for children and students’ winter vacation. It will provide a great opportunity for them to enjoy artwork that is not limited to a certain genre of art or the history of art.

234,153,An Exhibition of Works of Art by Choi Duk Hyu: A Collection by the Seoul Museum of Art,,Seoul Museum of Art,2011-09-30,2011-11-13,,,,,,oil paintings and watercolors,45 pieces ,,,"This retrospective exhibition of works of art by, Choi Duk Hyu, is being held to commemorate the donation of works by deceased artist, Choi Duk Hyu, to the Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA). Choi Duk Hyu was a painter who pioneered a new style of naturalism, an activist who worked for Korea’s independence during Japanese colonization, and an art educator who opened a new horizon of landscape painting. In 2007, the Seoul Museum of Art received 78 pieces of his valuable oil and watercolor paintings that were donated by the family of the artist. This exhibition will showcase a total of 45 pieces of his representative works, which include 29 pieces from the donation, 13 pieces from the collection of the Choi Duk Hyu Memorial Hall, and 3 pieces from the collection of the National Museum of Contemporary Art.  Painter Choi Duk Hyu (1922-1998) was born in Hongseong, Chungcheongnam-do in 1922. He dreamt of becoming a painter under the influence of his art teacher Chang Bal during his second year in Whimoon Middle School in Seoul. Between 1941 and 1943, he majored in Western painting at the Tokyo Teikoku Art School (now Musashino Art University). It is well known that his activities with the Gwangbokgun (Korean Restoration Army) had the greatest influence on his painting throughout his life. During his schooling at the Tokyo Teikoku Art School, he was assigned as a student soldier to the 64th Division of the Japanese Army and was stationed in Manchuria. During that time, he barely succeeded in escaping from the army. In 1945, he joined Gwangbokgun as an independence activist and fought for Korea’s independence from Japan. In 1950, he volunteered to enlist himself in the Korean Army during the Korean War, fought against North Korean forces, and was discharged from the army as a lieutenant in 1956. Painter Choi Duk Hyu was an artist of Western painting who developed a new painting style of naturalism and he was also an art teacher who devoted his life to fostering new artists at Kyunghee University as he sublimated his passion for art in the battlefields.  This exhibition will systematically shed new light on major works of art by painter Choi Duk Hyu, which were created between the early 1940s and the mid 1990s. It will display 38 pieces of oil painting and 7 pieces of watercolor paintings such as “Musasino Farm,” “The Streets of Washington,” “Five Colors of Red Pine Trees,” and “Jeongreung and Miari.”  His works of art that were created between the 1940s-1950s attempted a new naturalism painting style as a nonrepresentational, abstract natural expression. As a whole, they were realistic but partially remind us of Fauvism. His colors also concentrated on creating a beautiful harmony. During the 1960s-70s when he was active internationally, his artistic sense of colors demonstrated his internal change as a matured artist very well. During the 1970s-80s, Choi Duk Hyu showed a strong affection and attachment towards Seoul, and painted the scenic view of Seoul intensively. He was like a recorder of Seoul’s change by creating a series of masterpiece works. Among his landscape paintings of Seoul, where his lively brush strokes and abundant colors were expressed, a series of paintings describing the forest of buildings of Seoul, which has now grown to become an international city, show off the city very well.  This exhibition of Choi Duk Hyu’s art works has been specially planned to pay tribute and express appreciation for the donation of his works by his bereaved family, and it intends to raise the public’s awareness about the culture of donation through this event.

This year, New Acquisitions 2010 presents around 60 pieces which have been chosen out of the 278 collected in 2010, due to limited space. With this exhibition the museum seeks to share the result of its a-year-long acquisition activities with citizens as well as to explore new tendencies in contemporary art.   Collecting artworks is one of the most crucial projects of the museum. Through two to three times of open application processes every year, the museum acquires artworks in a wide range of genres and by an extensive scope of artists, which allows to trace a possible genealogy of Korean contemporary art. The museum concentrates on establishing its collections showcasing the spectrum of contemporary art rather than focusing too much on a specific period, movement or artist.

177,132,Korean Fantasy Painting: The Sensual Reinterpretation of Korean Paintings,,"Namseoul Gallery, Seoul Museum of Art ",2010-09-03,2010-10-17,,,,,,,,,,"“The Seoul MOA collection shows viewers how Korean painting developed from the traditional styles through to the contemporary.”  “The exhibition provides a valuable opportunity to appreciate art based on the aesthetic consciousness and mood of Korea but present in very contemporary forms.”   &lt;Korean Fantasy Painting - The Sensual Reinterpretation of Korean Paintings&gt; is being held from September 3 through October 17 at the Namseoul gallery of the Seoul Museum of Art. The aim of the exhibition is to provide visitors with a new perspective on the MOA’s collection through its careful selection of Korean paintings that reflect the trends and recent innovations in this area.   The “Korean Fantasy Painting” exhibition, the very first of its kind, displays a selection of high-level Korean paintings from the Seoul MOA’s collection that are based on the aesthetic consciousness and mood of Korea yet visualized in very contemporary forms, along with borrowed witty pieces in a similar context. Given the fact that the works of veteran, mid-level, and new artists, who have steadily been striving to express their individual colors and worlds, rather than simply imitating and responding to traditional visuality, are being displayed together in the same space, this exhibition is considered as being truly significant and valuable.   The exhibition is divided into the two sections according to the subject matter. Section I, Variations of Landscape Paintings, is located on the first floor and introduces art based on traditional landscape paintings whilst reflecting the artists’ own colors. Section 1 displays some traditional sumie landscape paintings by Byeon Gwan-sik and Kim Eun-ho as well as representative pieces of 1st generation Korean painters after liberation. Such painters developed their own painting methods based on traditional methods. Also featured are mid-level artists, with a more abstract and intense style, who were taught by the 1st generation artists, and young artists brimming with the spirit of experimentation. The presented selection of work allows the viewer to note the trends Korean landscape painting has followed over time.   Section II, Daily Lives of Modern Men, is located on the second floor and presents the diversity of daily life for a modern man as expressed using very Korean media, paper, writing brushes and ink sticks. The dry and prosaic surroundings of modern men, in particular city men, have long been an inspiration for many artists. Section II displays work created from various perspectives and approaches, including a face full of trouble reflecting the times, a work that pursues abstract spirit expressed through human, and a work that follows the faces of modern men from an unusual perspective.  Through these meaningful and interesting works, viewers will be enticed into the wide and deep world of empathy that the artists have spread before them. As always, the artists are concerned with maintaining a deep and close bond with the public. In addition, we hope that this exhibition will serve as an opportunity to bring back what ‘Korean characteristics’ means upon ourselves. It is also expected that the Seoul Museum of Art will attract the attention of residents, students and citizens by providing a new kind of experience with its specifically themed Korean painting collection. One that has never been seen before.

The museum purchases valuable works two to three times a year across all categories and artists to avoid the acquisition from being too partialto a particular group or trend. The acquisition must portray the direction of contemporary art. From1988 to September 2011, Seoul Museum of Art has collected 3,131 pieces, ranging from masters that passed away to bright new stars on theirway to accomplishing Korean contemporary art history.

233,150,City_net Asia 2011 Asian Contemporary art project,,"Seoul Museum of Art, 2nd, 3rd",2011-09-16,2011-11-20,,,,,,"Entire modern art genres including painting/drawing, photography, video art, installation and performance ",50 works,,,"Launched with a goal to introduce Asian contemporary art to the global art market currently dominated by Western art and promote Asian art in it via reviewing its current situation and finding measures to consolidate its position in the contemporary art world, the biennial event for the promotion of the Asian modern art project holds its 5th event this year under the title, City_net Asia 2011.  This year’s event is focused on all kinds of nature- or human-caused disasters that devastated communities all across Asia, dealing with a range of socio-cultural issues disrupting the urban environments in context of dystopia. The event is also aimed to lead viewers to pay closer attention to misfortunes around them and find measures to handle them via contemporary art. This year’s event, City_net Asia 2011, invites artists recommended by curators from major art institutions not just from Northeast Asia but Southeast Asia as well, and presents works handling local issues in the context of the dystopian reality. The event is expected to offer visitors an opportunity to look at the situations surrounding many local cities and reactions and attitudes of art towards them via the entire spectrum of viewpoints toward geological and political disasters and strategies to survive them.  This year’s exhibition is participated by leading art institutions in four Asian cities, the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art in Kanazawa, Japan, the Jim Thompson Art Center in Bangkok, Thailand, Ruangrupa in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Seoul Museum of Art in Seoul, Korea. The event is expected to offer art lovers an opportunity to ponder on various issues many Asian cities face today and will in the future. The various viewpoints the artists have towards the today’s Asian art and urban life will help viewers have a rare artistic experience.   #1. Seoul Natural disasters can strike us anytime and any where. We witnessed Seoul severely hit by flood last summer and the Sungnyemun Gate, a symbol of the city, burnt down. Likewise, suicide spreads like an epidemic, killing several thousand Korean people, from teenagers to the elderly, every year. Silent Conflict is conceived from that great disasters are caused by contradictions and conflicts immanent in the systems formed in the guise of order. It aims to look into the hidden side of the contemporary world in which disasters are consumed as spectacle images. The disasters left scars behind them which have a profound influence upon the physical, mental and psychological aspects of the human society. The repressed conflicts and hidden contradictions in our society can lead to an explosion when the time is ripe, leaving a lasting impact upon all its members.  The works in this exhibition deal with various social and political issues although there is no direct slogan about them. The artists try to make a statement about political incidents through individuals sacrificed by political systems, guiding viewers to the social, cultural and psychological scars left to individuals by the total power.  #2. Jakarta Disasters always leave us some material and spiritual damage or loss. In an urban context the word ‘disaster’ has a broader and more complex meaning related with damage or loss incurred by ignorance of design and policies. In the Indonesian cities the source of ‘power’ is no more God, bureaucrats or business policies. The will or authority of God or Nature may be invisible but is powerful, infinite and even unpredictable in most cases.  In the works sent for this exhibition, Ruangrupa artists focus their attention on people’s survival tactics in the midst of disaster, one sweeping a city in particular. The subjects of their works include damage and loss in an urban environment, and experiment, renovation and sustainability in accordance with social systems and bureaucracy. The exhibition is expected to show how we ordinary citizens set up and operate tactics to survive in all the destructive forces generated in an urban environment, and what strategies and tactics artists and designers develop to tackle such situation.  Visitors to the exhibition will be guided to a great variety of approaches and views on survival in an urban environment, researches on survival strategy, mapping, efforts to create a new space from the ruins of an old space, sustainable design, and how individuals and groups in a city manage loss, damage and dream.  #3. Kanazawa A massive tsunami combined with powerful earthquakes hit the Japan’s northeastern region on March 11, 2011. The natural disaster led to the collapse of a nuclear power plant in Fukushima whose tragic outcome still attracts worldwide media coverage and heated debates all across the world regarding the scope and aftermath of the disaster. The Fukushima nuclear disaster woke us to two questions: What should we do to handle the new “daily life”? What terrible wrongdoing have we been engaged in and still are? The questions demand us to reconsider basic ethics and norms of behavior. We are now fallen into a trap of dismay of pain and trying to flee from the chaos for a breathing space.  We have been held on to the myth of “development” from the belief that the development of science and economy would bring happiness to us. Market economy has exerted a strong influence upon us, and we have been effectively hidden from the serious problems and dangers immanent in it. Today, we need to find a ‘force’ that can help us get over through art the 20th century studded with tragic incidents and imagine something new. We need to show through art strengths and potentiality with which we can stand again after directly facing disasters such as the one that hit Fukushima. At the same time, we should handle the emotional wounds and pain in a careful, thoughtful manner. Modern art is not an activity remote from daily life of human beings. We as modern people can find harmony of life and meaning of existence through art.  #4. Bangkok  This exhibition is aimed at investigation and analysis of the cause and outcome of the disasters troubling Bangkok, and Thailand. The disasters bringing fatal outcomes to this city are not caused by nature but humans, poor infrastructure, socio-economic environment resulting in grave inequality, and political conflicts. As in many countries of the Third World, disasters striking Thailand are largely caused by chronic political instability and the conflict between the traditional value and the effort for modernization. The title “Bang-kok 2011” shows a wordplay regarding the current urban situations in which a political conflict results in disruption among its citizens. The exhibition is focused on the social and political disruptions of last May that left a deep scar to the citizens’ memories. The key question is related with a virtual or imaginary world related with the city of Bangkok and the question: “Where is this city originated, where is it today, and where is it heading for?” With the question, the works in this exhibition deal with urban landscapes and situations in which people deal with the reality they are situated. There are also works focused on the virtual or imaginary conditions and a way to look at the real world which is beyond what is fabricated by the state and the media. These works are key witnesses of the modern society and culture, and people’s agony, trauma, and terror about the uncertain future.

A Trip to the Museum exhibit features first-hand pieces by children, teens, disabled, and multi-national children who attended the Citizen Art Academy at Seoul Museum of Art.  It is said that we become adults when we learn how to appreciate the beauty of life. As the saying goes, art education must start at childhood and continue into the teens. The Seoul Museum of Art has been involved in activities to get children accustomed to art at a young age, the Art School for Children and Teens being one of them.  The early 2011 theme for the Art School for Children and Teens was to createa ‘Happy World’ where children from all ethnic origins come together in one happy society with or without handicaps. They participated in artistic activities after school and during summer school.  The class will continue with another three-hundred students for four or eight weeks. Being the starlets of the future, they expressed their hopes and dreams to come. Together they drew one big happy world with their own hands.  The children who participated in the art classes will experience the thrills of having their work displayed to the public. For the viewers it will present a fresh new look on art with unique approaches and clever ideas.

Staged in a two-story building of the Nam Seoul Annex Building, the exhibition is divided into two sections: ‘Looking Back on the World’ (1st fl.) and ‘Communication with the World’ (2nd fl.). Visitors will have an opportunity to appreciate familiar images from their daily life from different perspectives. Ⅰ. Looking Back on the World In the process of recreating cartoon characters, the artists have expressed their multi-dimensional and plane works in a critical, introspective, satirical and ironic manner by fusing their own sensibility with their original meaning. Their works of art are romantic, but contain the perspectives of artists who are looking back on the world. Ⅱ. Communication with the World In addition to providing visual enjoyment to visitors, this exhibition displays multi-dimensional, plane, and animated works of art, which deliver the messages of communication, play, joy and sharing by inducing visitors to participate while viewing exhibitions of familiar cartoon characters from their childhood.

Our goal is to present a new and constructive direction for Korean art.  This exhibition concentrates on the works of fourteen established artists who each have a unique place in Korea’s art scene. It will shed light on the images’ rhetoric, which induces communication with the public, thereby generating social meaning.  The works to be presented at the exhibition have been carefully picked from among pieces that can be immediately recognized as figurative “images,” with a view to eliciting discussion about what each of the fourteen artists are trying to express to the audience and what methods they have chosen to do so. This exhibition is composed of artists whose ages range from the forties to the sixties, so all of them have spent twenty, thirty or even forty years in the field experimenting with aesthetics and with variations throughout their career. Some may have settled for a specific method of expression, others are still on their way. Instead of categorizing the works by theme or concept, the exhibition is composed in such a way that the artists’ track can be followed through from start to finish.  In other words, this exhibition is an extensive study on master artists who are now pillars of the Korean contemporary art scene. Not only will the exhibition reveal to us the current whereabouts of our art, but it will also give us an idea of where it is heading.

The show takes a three-dimensional view of Seoul’s dynamism in the past and present and flow into the future. It also looks at Seoul from diverse standpoints as capital of a country, a civilized metropolis, and site for many people’s lives. The exhibition also sheds light on how Seoul has been reflected through art by many artists who have worked with the motif of urban space.  Section 1. Breath of the city  This section consists of paintings through which viewers may feel the breath of the city in scenes of Seoul seen through the eyes of mid-career and senior artists. These paintings reflect circumstances of the times and Seoul in lyric realism.  Section 2. The city of people  In this section the participating artists present Seoul as a base of fluid urban life. They reel off their individual experiences, such as unfamiliarity with Seoul itself; the reinterpretation of overlapped space; the toughness of urban life; the problems caused by pervasive individualism; leisure culture downtown; and daily life in industrialized urban space.

Seoul Museum of Art,2011-04-26,2011-06-26,,,,,,,,,,"Several exhibitions are being prepared to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Korea and Australia this year. Among them is an exhibition entitled 'Korea?Australia Exchange Exhibition: Australia_Digital Urban Portraits' host by Seoul Museum of Art, which shows the current and future urban images and people from Australia. The goal is to strengthen diplomatic ties between the two countries in the coming years.    This exhibition consists of two parts: Part I-'FACE TO FACE Portraiture in digital age'; and Part II-'NOW and WHEN Australian Urbanism'. Part I poses questions on how new media and digital technology have changed the portrait, face, perception of identity, and thought of contemporary man. ‘Face to Face’ can be understood as 'Meeting face to face' or 'Confrontation'. Artists who participate in Part I depict their impression of the digital age in their works. While Part I emphasizes the identity and relations between people, depicting quite a different world from those of the analogue era, Part II contains visual introspections of the present and future cities. Such works made in 3D videos were once presented at the Australia Exhibition Hall during the 12th Venice Architecture held in 2010, under the same title. This exhibition is brought to you by the collaboration of Australian Architectural Association, which has received a great recognition since the 2005 Venice Architecture Biennale, and creative director and photographer John Gollings. This 15-minute video is comprised of ‘Now’ (6 minutes running time) and 'When’ (9 minutes running time).  Australia's representative media art works which are presented in this exhibition will provide a good opportunity for visitors to look back at our own portraits and to think about how urban culture will come about.

Seoul has been continually developing, expanding and evolving. Now is the time for Seoul to stop changing and retrospect itself for a moment. Thus, Seoul, so-called fast-paced city, needs a mirror for looking into itself. Such a mirror is none other than its photos. This event aims to utilize photo records so that Seoul may examine and introspect itself, with an ultimate view to returning Seoul back to Seoul.  ○ In this respect, the 2010 Seoul Photo Festival is distinctly different from the previous photo-related festivals since it is highly intended for the sake of Seoul citizens. In the Seoul Photo Festival, Seoul citizens will be able to look into and find themselves. For this purpose, a thesaurus of photo materials derived from Seoul-related photo archives will be categorized, conceptualized and exhibited in this festival, in which photographers will display and demonstrate such aspects of Seoul as we have never seen or encountered. At the same time, there will be some exhibitions and workshops in which citizens can participate, enjoy and learn. Professionals as well as common citizens will be able to attend and relish various levels of programs. In the workshop, photos, which have remained in its closed field, will seek for an opportunity to actively communicate with the other fields of art and culture.

We cannot single out Chagall’s works in Russian Period (1910-22), known as the zenith of Chagall’s artistic career.

This work is composed of Introduction to the Jewish Theatre , Wedding Table , Love on the Stage , Literature , Theatre , Music and Dance . These works, having been left alone more than fifty years after the theater was closed because of Stalin’s seizure of power, were restored by a Swiss foundation in 1987 and recovered to their original forms, and are now in The State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow. Especially, Introduction to the Jewish Theatre and Wedding Table , supersized works about 8 meters in width, first on view in Asia, are shown in a dramatic exhibition setting of the entire works, including four panels having already visited to Seoul in 2004. Decoration of Jewish Theatre , showing Chagall’s artistic and philosophical inspiration, is the best work in this exhibition. I and the Village , faces of fairy-tale world seen by Chagall This exhibition is organized to emphasize Chagall’s style―the combination of dreamy, fairy-tale description and splendid color. The most publicly well-known works are the masterpieces produced in Russian Period, I and the Village (1912), painted in gouache; Over the Town (1914-18), a painting on beautiful lovers flying in the sky; and Promenade (1917-18), a painting on fairy-tale love story. These works, shipped from museums in Brussels, Moscow and Saint Petersburg, are the best works and the zenith of Chagall’s art. Insurance Estimated Value Reaching up to One Trillion-Won The price of Chagall’s works has been drastically increased in the art market. The artist’s works on view are mostly in public art museum collections, the price of which is incalculable.

The insurance estimated value of the seven entire works of Decoration of Jewish Theatre is 280 billion won, and that of Over the City and Promenade is 50 billion won each, which is the highest-priced estimate on individual piece.  “There is only one color in our life that gives a meaning to the life and the art, the color of love.”Marc Chagall  2. Scale and Organization of the Exhibition Supersized exhibition of 160 Chagall’s works from 30 worldwide collections Chagall’s second retrospective in succession of 2004 Exhibition presents more in-depth subjects and more colorful works among his masterpieces.

This monumental retrospective, overwhelming 2004 Chagall Exhibition in its quality and contents, shows Chagall’s various works from the early to the late years coming from all over the world, in a thematic and chronological order. Thematic organization to easily understand Chargall’s art ? 1 I and the Village, Russian Period 1910-1922 In Russia Period, an adolescent Chagall painted his indigenous life and dreamy ideal. Masterpieces from this period are I and the Village , Over the Town , and Promenade .

Illustrated prints based on classics, such as Four Tales from Arabian Nights , Daphnis and Chloe,  and Fables of La Fontaine , are on view.  Chagall’s Art World painted by Love The most distinguished artist in the 20th century, Marc Chagall, was a Jewish French born in Vitebsk, Russia. During his long 98 year-life, he tried nearly every medium: oil paintings, prints, wall paintings, stained glass, stage sets, and murals and ceiling paintings in the huge structures, such as Opera Houses and museums. Above all, Chagall was a transformative artist. He developed his unique, romantic style in combining his childhood experience when living in the Jewish village and his imagination and in accepting strong colors from Fauvism and a new idea of space from Cubism. Like most avant-garde artists, Chagall was able to transform the genre, color and form in changing and overlapping various art genres. Chagall’s art, so childlike and mysterious that is not categorized in any other contemporary art genres, deeply influenced on the birth of Surrealism. Like he said in his autobiography that “I didn’t have one single painting that didn’t breathe with the sprit and reflection [of Vitebsk],” the everyday-life motif of flower, animal, the folklore of countryside village, bride and lovers appear in free forms in his canvases. Also, Chagall, who frequently paints fairy-tale-like world, country life and lovers flying in the sky, left us beautiful works like dreams, such asI and the Village (1912), Over the Town (1914-18) and Promenade (1917-18). The pieces of his memories and imagination acquired through his long life were incised in the domain of vision―in his canvas―surpassing the domain of time. Chagall’s works show his pursuit of passion and love through his entire life and his unique color in a dreamy world.

179,136,Modern Korean Sculpture - The Seoul Art Exhibition 2010,,1Fl. Seoul Museum of Art,2010-12-01,2010-12-19,,,,Tue. ~ Sat. 10:00~21:00 / Sun. and holiday 10:00~20:00,,Sculpture ,65 pieces ,,,"The Seoul Art Exhibition is an annual event held by the Seoul Museum of Art that highlights the current modern art trends in Korea. From 1985 to 2003, the exhibition displayed the works of representative doyen artists of the time across diverse types, including Korean painting, Western painting, print, and sculpture. Since 2004, the works exhibited in the event have been divided into several categories, including painting, sculpture, handicraft, and print. Such an arrangement was aimed at providing a more professional insight into each category and drawing attention to often overlooked categories.   The main focus of this year’s event will be modern Korean “sculpture.” In particular, this year’s event will not categorize work according to traditional formality or historical classifications, such as representational or abstract, but will adopt a comprehensive approach that illustrates various aspects of modern Korean sculpture. The invitation of artists was decided through meetings of the Exhibition Advisory Committee as part of the effort to secure maximum fairness and objectivity, and the works were selected were among the most recently produced to give a the clearest picture of modern Korean sculpture.   Since today’s art world is characterized by a blurring of the borders between genres and many attempts to fuse media are taking place, what can be included in the genre of ‘sculpture’ is not clear either. Furthermore, the features of sculpture, such as material choice, 3-dimensional formation, and the relationship between artwork and space, give the genre a greater potential for expansion than other genres.   In order for the exhibition to contain not only traditional sculptures but also those embodying new and diverse concepts, the planning process started with the simple premise ‘contemporary modern Korean sculpture’ as its one and only guideline. Such an approach embraced various types of artwork that were created as ‘sculptures’ by the artists in question and thus avoided the limited, stereotypical view of sculpture. In this manner, the exhibition, through its 65 sculptures, has been able to best demonstrate the evolutionary trends in Korean sculpture. In addition to the traditional sculptures, there are many pieces that were created using non-traditional sculpture formats, installations and media. These include mixed-genre sculptures, pieces using new media that as yet have not been categorized as traditional sculpture materials, and installations that illustrate uncertain conditions.

174,133,The 6th Seoul International Biennale of Media Art,Trust,Seoul Museum of Art,2010-09-07,2010-11-17,http://mediacityseoul.org,,Seoul Metropolitan GovernmentOrganizer: Seoul Museum of Art(SeMA),,,,,,,"TrustMedia City Seoul announces the sixth edition of the biennial under the title Trust. To connect with the rest of the world, we invest a certain amount of trust in various relations. Trust is by default an ambiguous notion, it is one grounded in good faith as much as in doubt. As individuals we not only have these relations to our fellow citizens, but also increasingly with modes of connection. With proliferating forms of media, information comes to us in many guises, and the message is more and more opaque; marketing poses as friendship, solitude as community, populism as democracy. Instead of simply stepping up to the speed of technology, the curatorial team of Media City Seoul 2010 proceeds from a desire to pause, reflect, and critique the transitions and transformations of our social contexts. The exhibition is propositional by nature. Trust interprets media broadly?as a tool for engagement within a shifting terrain where political, national or religious identities are being re-charted; where means of distribut ion creates real and imagined communities; and where private interpersonal space share the same platform as global political issues of the day. As forms of media become more accessible and varied, we enter an era that seemingly allows more room for self-expression and individuality. Yet, what is at stake when media channels are more concentrated and powerful? How do these networks create new spaces of alienation and control? How do we reconcile the desire for changing social models, with a desire for new communities? The exhibition works against the rhetoric of technology as progress and promise, offering instead a recalibration of its definition. Many of the artists in the exhibition are not known as media artists, but use various forms of media (printed material, urban detritus, photographic and video technology, documentary and fictional forms) to counter the generalizing of experience by dominant narratives. Trust investigates notions of community, representation and perception in a world that is continuously being retold and reconfigured. In this light, how are stories, histories and myths construed? How is collective experience represented through multiplicity and difference? The exhibition emphasizes artistic practices that play with documentary conventions, fictional forms, espousing for imagination, subjectivity and localities as underpinnings of contemporary experience. Sometimes revealing the underlying constructs of mediated stories, and at other times obscuring them. Trust does not aim to meticulously dissect the matters at hand, or present a scientific or intellectual study of our current mediascape. Instead, Trust offers a broad interpretation of media and invests in a humanistic and individual response to contemporary experience.

171,130,Man Ray’s Photography & His Heritage ,,1Fl. Seoul Museum of Art,2010-06-16,2010-08-15,,,,,,,Around a hundred and sixty photographs ,Forty-Seven contemporary photographers and Man Ray,,"The Photographs of Man Ray and His Friends is a tribute to, and meditation on, the achievement of Man Ray, one of the pioneers of artistic photography. The exhibit also serves to explore the contribution by forty-seven contemporary artists from home and abroad who were deeply influenced by Man Ray’s photographs and his artistic spirit. The exhibit is divided into three sections under three different themes to look into Man Ray and the contemporary artists influenced by him.  The first theme is photography as a record of reality. Portraits, fashion photos, advertisements, and documentary photographs fall into this category. Even though photographs seem to rigidly imprison the outlines of whatever they capture, the images taken by camera are not merely simple traces. In photographs, historical, social, and political happenings are recorded in the artist’s unique style.  The second theme is photography emphasizing the subjective, creative and inimitable. If the purpose of photographs is not objective or commercial, photographs can be much more experimental. The unique techniques and technologies of photographs open new doors for artistic expression. Additionally, photographs allow us witness the accidental or things not seen in a conventional manner.  The third and final theme is the world of fiction and imagination. These photographs bring to life fantasy worlds using photography-unique techniques not employed in reproductive photographs. These techniques include double printing, solarization, retouching, shaking, restructuring of frame, and Rayogram.

176,129,Artists' Production ,,"Namseoul Gallery, Seoul Museum of Art ",2010-06-04,2010-08-22,,,,,,,,,,"Collaboration between modern art and products “Between the Art Gallery and Department Store” Modern artists collapse the wall between artworks and products, and communicate with the public  The Artists’ Production Exhibition held in the Nam Seoul Annex Building of Seoul Museum of Art (Director Yoo Hee-Young) from June 4 through August 22, 2010 is an introduction to the converging trend of artworks and products, commercial advertisements, and designs that function as a brand. The exhibition displays products created by modern art and product brands, and artists’ works that have been incorporated with the concept of products.  The attempt to mix fine art with popular culture and industry by an art museum, however, is not new. The collaboration between artists and brands, an increasingly popular trend today, is becoming a way to promote artists’ works to the public, and for brands, the collaboration enables them to create a higher value. In other words, such collaboration between modern art and products has become an important axis that forms the world of the artists’ works.  Artists of the 21st Century leap beyond the 20th Century-style production of pop art, which considered the artists’ work room as a “factory”, as so named by Andy Warhol, that manufactured products that would satisfy the desire of consumers in a mass consuming society. Their work is based on a concept of “production” which brings to mind a type of small-and-medium size enterprise. They are created in a systematic way through phases such as creation, production, marketing and promotion, to step closer to the public through large-scale collaboration. In addition, well-known artists often operate online and offline stores to sell art products and items that they create. Downtown department stores design their outer walls with artist’s projects or display their products along with art pieces to cross a boundary between their products and sophisticated art.  Yet, together with the assessment that this is a strategy to find a point of interaction with the public or that it is a new form of pop art, criticism that modern art has been degraded to a peripheral part of a product, and controversy over mass production and the uniqueness of art works continue. Twelve teams of artists and designers take part in this exhibition in a bid to study the diverse thoughts and artistic attitudes toward this phenomenon. They deliver a message to society by becoming an artistic brand and exhibiting a popularized piece of work or as a form of vandalism, using products, stickers, logos and graffiti to convey their determination on their ideas and ‘change’.  Through these works, which are journeys to discover new artistic values with a pop art or activism attitude, we hope to examine how modern art is being applied in different fields, and the appeal of modern art as a product. The exhibition will identify new ways to approach the general public and expand the scope of artist’s work through the work of modern artists that break down walls dividing artistic works and products, and communicate with the public.

This special exhibition will provide comfortable and free access to beautiful and witty artworks amidst the spring buds and blooms of SeMA. Thus, visitors will have fun whilst improving their appreciation of art. In addition, this exhibition, along with the special exhibition ‘RETROSPECTIVE RODIN’ to be held in parallel, will present the physical energy of sculptures from diverse viewpoints.  This year’s theme, ‘FANTASY FAIRY TALE’, will allow visitors to become a fairy tale hero and to travel through a world of fantasy inspired by the surrealistic artwork of a type only usually encountered in their imagination. A fairy tale is a story for children involving magical events and imaginary creatures not bound by time and space. However, the moralistic lessons embedded in the narratives of fairy tails are not limited to children. The exhibition intends to provide visitors with a fun and relaxing atmosphere where they can enjoy the arts in the open and fresh air.  As a visitor is ushered into the museum to a fresh, green, esculent scent, he or she becomes a hero or heroine of a fairy tail and starts a fantastic journey. Not only children, but also adults who are accustomed to treadmill-like existence, will feel a shiver of excitement as soon as they take the first step into a world of fantasy. Artwork, which is stationary yet seems to be moving dynamically, located along the pathway of the museum talks to visitors. The exhibition would like to give visitors the chance to broaden their viewpoints toward objects, through such dynamic and fantastic pieces.   The works express the themes of fantasy whilst maintaing their realistic aspects. Their lyricism through poetic fantasy and new perspectives, which balance realism with fantasy, will take us on a voyage deep into our imagination.

170,126,RETROSPECTIVE RODIN,,"Seoul Museum of Art, 2nd, 3rd",2010-04-30,2010-08-22,http://www.rodinseoul.com/,,,,,,,,,"Since the opening of its first exhibition “Chagall: Magician of Color” in 2004, the Hankook Ilbo has been constantly organizing landmark exhibitions of world-renowned artists such as Picasso, Monet, Van Gogh and Renoir, helping the people get more familiar to art. As an extension of these successive events, with great anticipation and excitement, we would like to invite you to the upcoming extravaganza, “Rodin: Retrospective.” A must-see event dedicated to the world-famous sculptor, Auguste Rodin, the exhibition will be held at the Seoul Museum of Art from Apr. 30 to Aug. 22, 2010 in collaboration with KBS (Korean Broadcasting System). Rodin, who has been praised as “Michelangelo Reincarnated” or the progenitor of modern sculpture, successfully converted lifeless materials into sculptures imbued with delicate human feelings such as passion, agony, love and hatred. He accomplished the process passionately and emotionally and, indeed, kept same attitude to his private life. Surely, his art can not be interpreted without knowing the artist’s personal relationships. The love affair with his pupil Camille Claudel, often depicted as complicated but ardent love, is even understood as a part of his genius. As a consequence, Passion and Love are the key elements that fulfilled Rodin’s affinity for art. One of the Rodin’s biggest accomplishments a historical change to the period of radical upheaval in the late 19th century art. He upgraded the status of sculpture that had long been downgraded to a decorative public monument since the Renaissance to a higher one, an independent place where only pure and creative works can stand. In the process of questioning and answering ‘what made Rodin a great sculptor?’ his talent and artistic originality are the chief elements to be emphasized. These two keywords not solely earned Rodin a world-wide fame, but also enabled him to realize the idiosyncratic harmonization of both composition and abstraction, especially shown in Balzac. With his dynamic sculptures, the combination of body and soul in human figure, Rodin is still extolled as a pathfinder and precursor of modern sculpture. As a first retrospective of Rodin in Korea, this exhibition offers a unique opportunity to gain a thorough insight into life and career of the artist, who is second to none in modern sculpture. Here, visitors will meet what has Rodin left behind, works executed in pursuance of realizing not solely the human figures but also the realm of God.

185,125,Oh Seung Woo,,"1stfloor,MainBuildingofSeosomun",2010-04-23,2010-05-30,,,,"Weekdays 10:00 ~ 21:00, Weekends 10:00~19:00",,,60 Paintings,,,"The Oh Seung Woo Exhibition will be held in the Seoul Museum of Art (Director Yoo Hee Young) from April 23 to May 30. This exhibition was organized to commemorate the donation of his work by the renowned artist. The exhibition will highlight the broad range of his artwork from that of his early period to his most recent works. Born the son of the painter Oh Ji Ho ? a pioneer of Western-style painting in Korea - Oh Seung Woo received special recognition in Korea’s National Art Exhibition at the age of 27. He went on to join the ranks of prominent recommended artists when he was 31. Since then Oh Seung Woo has left a prominent mark on Korean art. He was given the Seoul Culture Award and served as president of the Mokwoohoe Fine Arts Association.   In this collection, you will see paintings from each distinctive time period that focus on distinctive themes. Indeed, this artist liked to dwell on a single subject for a long time before moving on to the next one. For every subject that he chose to explore, he would dig deep into that subject. This enabled him to pursue his quest into the hidden cultural and spiritual contexts surrounding his chosen themes.   This exhibition will feature all of Oh Seung Woo’s 60 representative works. On show will be a series of paintings on the themes of ancient relics, a flower and girl, mountains, and the 10 traditional symbols of longevity. The exhibition, which also commemorates the donation of his work by the artist, will be a valuable opportunity to see first-hand the artist’s entire oeuvre, from his early works to his more current ones.    In the painter’s early years, he travelled around the country’s many Buddhist temples and chose images of Buddha and Buddhist scriptures as the subjects for his canvas. Many of his paintings from this period received special acclaim in the National Art Exhibition. His choice of subject was not only influenced by his family ancestry but can also be seen as his own personal journey in search of his roots. Later, in the 1960s, his paintings began to explore a fantasy world, far from reality, where flowers and girls became the center of his artistic world. In the 1980s, Oh Seung Woo travelled around the country’s mountains to put them on canvas. His work during this period expresses the inner most corners of his home country and reflects his awe for nature. In the 1990s, he traveled around neighboring countries, such as China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar, to transpose the energy of ancient relics onto his canvas using strong vivid colors and powerful strokes that were ‘like roaring flames’. The fascination he had for fantasy during the 1960s returned to him in his later years in the form of the 10 traditional symbols of longevity. Such recent work reveals a transfiguration of tradition and modernity into a new spirit of the times. Dwelling on a single subject for extended periods of time gave the artist the freedom to pursue his deep quest for the origins of culture. The artist also digs deep into his own personal roots from where he constructs his own unique artistic world.   Art critic Oh Gwang Soo points out that “the common thread in Oh Seung Woo’s artwork is nature and culture.” He adds that such themes of nature and culture are “part of a past heritage that is reborn in the context of our current times.” This in fact is a distinctive trait of Oh Seung Woo’s art. This exhibition covering the artist’s early to more recent work is a valuable opportunity to join the artist in his anthropological journey in the quest for the origins of culture.   ▣ The Structure of the Exhibition  The Oh Seung Woo exhibition is divided into different time periods, each with its own distinctive theme. This exhibition will be an exciting opportunity to view his entire oeuvre and see how his interests and styles have evolved with each stage of his life.   1. Ancient Relics and Folk Culture of Korea  The work that won special recognition in the National Art Exhibition was painted in the artist’s early years, between 1957 and 1960, and dealt consistently with Buddhist scriptures and temples. His choice of subject matter can be interpreted as an exploration into the origins of culture rather than a simple expression of Buddhist faith. During this period, the artist reproduced images in a relatively realistic way, expressing cultural energy and cultural roots with distinctively bright and powerful colors. Through influence from his mother’s side, he traveled around the country’s many temples where he became mesmerized by Buddhist structures and images. This journey into cultural origins found its way back into his work in the 1980s in his choice of folk elements, such as traditional ox fights and mills, in his many paintings portraying the traditional life of common people.   2. Flower and Girl  In the 1960s, Oh Seung Woo gradually broke free from his realistic depictions of nature to explore the world of fantasy. After his series of paintings of relics, he went on to paint a series of works on fairies in a fantasy world that revolved around a flower and girl. The ‘Flower and Girl’ series was mainly painted in the 1960s. Compared to the ‘Relics’ series, which employed a strong and clear color contrast, the ‘Flower and Girl’ series gradually incorporates white for a softer use of color. His dream-like portrayal of plants, animals, and people set against a mystical background seems to have led naturally to his next theme ? the 10 traditional symbols of longevity. In the ‘Flower and Girl’ series, Oh removes all concrete forms from the background, which is depicted as pure color, to strengthen the image of the fantasy world.   3. Korea’s 100 Mountains The ‘Korea’s 100 Mountains’ series was painted in the 1980s. In this series, Oh Seung Woo not only painted mountains, but impressively portrayed the inner most part of his homeland. Mountains are not subjects in themselves. Rather, in Oh’s paintings, they are there to express the energy of the territory. The artist rendered 130 mountains on canvas, including the famous Baekdu Mountain, Sorak Mountain, Jiri Mountain, and Halla Mountain. Oh guides you to the inner most flesh of the mountains, rather than just focusing on a three-dimensional contrast of distance. Thus, his mountains are actually symbolic mountains growing in the wilderness of his imagination.   4. Original Forms of the East The ‘Original Forms from the East’ series was mostly painted in the 1990s. In this series of work, we see a rampant use of flaming colors. Always in the center of a painting is a temple or a palace. The artist portrays centers of civilization and history in their most glorious forms. He traces the centers of civilization not only in China but also in the surrounding Eastern countries to express the splendor of Eastern culture. Temples and palaces are valuable in understanding Eastern civilization as the former is the center of spiritual and cultural life and the latter the center of secular power. The artist’s explorations into the temples, relics, and towers of India, China, Dunhuang, Japan, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, Nepal, Tibet, Indonesia, and Malaysia are energetically reflected in his paintings.   5. 10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity Oh Seung Woo began work on the ‘10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity’ series in the new millennium. Unlike his past ‘Korea’s 100 Mountains’ and ‘Original Forms from the East’ series, which culminated from his traveling to the places he painted, this final series relied more on the imagination. The ‘10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity’ series reflects the age-old ideals of Eastern civilization’s utopia. In that respect, the subject of this series is quite abstract compared to mountains or ancient relics. Nevertheless, the ‘10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity’ series reflects the yearnings of civilization. These longings have had a great influence on the spiritual and cultural life of Eastern civilization. They are common to people of all social status and, because of their powerful symbolism, are beloved by everyone. The ‘10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity’ series deals with concrete and tangible things, such as nature and living creatures, but paradoxically, become abstract as they are combined with the world of the imagination. The 10 Traditional Symbols of Longevity are actually traditional symbols, but as they reach the canvas of the artist, a new uniqueness is brought to the theme. The artist does not simply derive artistic themes from ancient relics but goes on to set the values reflected in these themes in a modern day context. This is an ideal way of passing on traditions. Oh Seung Woo’s art can be seen as a journey in pursuit of these values.   ▣ Related Events and Schedule   The opening ceremony of the exhibition will be held in the lobby of the Seoul Museum of Art, on April 22 (Thursday), at 5 PM. During the entire exhibition period, there a lecture will be held every day at 1PM to explain the artist’s work. Also open to the public is the ‘Museum Date with Oh Seung Woo’, which will feature an overview of the museum, ‘Curator Gallery Talk’, and much more, on April 28 (Wednesday), May 12 (Wednesday), May 19 (Wednesday), and May 26(Wednesday). A Free audio guide ‘Journey with the Artist’ will also be available to visitors. The audio guide will include commentaries on individual art works, artist’s notes and memoirs. The exhibition will be a special opportunity to view Oh Seung Woo’s full oeuvre and to commemorate his donation of such.

Seoul Museum of Art has collected about 300 works through total 3rd collecting activities in last year.  Among them, 253 works were purchased and 47 works  were donated. Seoul Museum of Art have collected works in several genres such as 49  Korean paintings, 131 western paintings, 15 printmaking, 43 sculptures, 15 handicrafts, 2 calligraphies, 37 photos, 7 media arts and 1 installation, and as the result, total collections of Seoul Museum of Art become 2,807works.   Looking at the trend of collection in 2009, firstly the works of the late major artists such as Yoo, Young-kuk, Kim, Whanki, Pyo, Seung-Hyeon, Choi, Wook-kyung, etc. who are the representative artists of Korean modern art have been collected, and Min, Gyeong-Gap who is one of representative Korean colored painters donated his 36 works including &lt;Wealth(剖)&gt; which was specially selected at National Art Exhibition. Thus, the collections of Korean paintings have been supplemented qualitatively. Also, we had planed the qualitative improvement for the composition of collections by supplementing the existing collections by the time and the genre through the works of artist Han, Mook, Chung, Tak-young, Shim, Jung-soo, Choi, Man-lin, Kim, Byung-jong, Hong, Seung-hye, Hwang, Yong-yop, Cha, Ou-hi, Kwon, Sun-Hyeong and etc.  Meanwhile, we have extended the function of collections as ‘public art’ close to citizen by installing outdoor sculptures of artist Lee, Sang-Gil, Kim, Bang-Heui, Oh, Sang-Il, Noh, Jun, Lee, Ki-Chil and etc. dividing 10 sculptures at outdoor place of Park of Seoul and 2 sculptures at outdoor place of Nanji Art Studio. In case of a sculpture, also, lots of works beyond the traditional materials and methods such as Ji, Yong-ho’s works making use of scrap tires, Yang, Young-Hoi’s works making use of scrap iron and etc. had been collected. For photos, the aspect of photo collections which placed weight on documentary photos in the past has become more abundant because various works showing the extended trends of modern photos had been largely collected.   A collection is the one of the most important factors showing the character and the mission of a museum as the foundation to be existed it. The collection of artistic works is the tool to establish the identity of all museums and also, the trend of collection becomes the standard to estimate the direction that a museum will go forward in the future. Seoul Museum of Art will continuously play the role as the driving force of Korean art by showing the history of Korean modern art and collecting substantial works that it is possible to introduce the dynamicity of modern arts as the modern museum representing Seoul. Also, we will make constantly an effort to secure collections which are the cultural heritage of citizen, preserve them carefully and share them with citizen much variously than before.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192839_9c1c11b6c1de4a768afda66caa5f955c_2d73c31257154cf2b3d2c801e2e921b1,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=169,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
164,115,The Cinematic Montage,,SeMA Namseoul Annex Building,2009-06-06,2009-10-04,,,,Mon ? Fri: 10 am to 8 pm / Saturday Sunday and holidays 10 am to 6 pm,,Entire section of modern art ,40pieces,,,"“Cheerful and serious works of the imagination unfold to disassemble and reassemble time and space in a huge cinema.”  “A fantastic moment of immersion in which the black box of a cinema turns into the white cube of an art gallery.” “The very point where the cinematographic illusion encounters a desire for pure art.”   The Cinematic Montage Today we live in a so called ‘era of composite images.” Cartoons, movies and TV dramas show a world that has been dismantled and then reassembled, representing it via the images composed by the superimposition or juxtaposition of disassembled pieces. This exhibition focuses on the development of the montage as part of the contemporary cultural background, and introduces a collection of montages made in various forms of modern art from socio-political criticism to surrealistic fantasy, monologue narration to visual rhythm.  Since the 20th century, modern art has developed a variety of forms and meanings in combination with the characteristic features of cinema. The term “cinematic” has formed an important discourse on contemporary art and is profusely used in various art genres, including painting, photography, installation and video. The technique of composing a work by mixing various elements of performance, sculpture, cinema and still pictures is now widely regarded as one of the most experimental and spectacular forms seen in the work of many contemporary artists. These works provide viewers with an environment in which they can immerse themselves in the exhibition, guiding them into a realm of imagination through a transcendence of time and space. This is the moment in which the mental activities taking place within the black box of a cinema become more active in the white cube of an art gallery.   What is the “montage technique”? ? Aestheticism of fragments The “montage technique,” which played a crucial role in the development of cinema in the 19th century, has now become a very important factor for building composite images of time and space. In this age of composition, the meaning and scope of montage has continued to expand to the extent that some conclude that “all viewpoints of the world form a single montage” and thus the montage is now treated as being more important than ever before. What is, then, the original meaning of the montage, how has it developed, and what are its characteristics? Montage is a French word meaning “putting together” and refers to a method of film editing that combines fragmentary film shots selected from separate films to create visual rhythms and psychological sensations by building a new reality in cinematic time and space. It may be compared with the technique of facial composite imaging in that separate memories are put together to “create” a single object. It involves not only technical but also mental and psychological fabrication, and the montage is completed in the eye of each viewer. The fabrication takes place through various methods of arranging fragments, such as juxtaposition, segmentation and combination, and generates meaning on a new level via the conflict of two opposing pieces.  This exhibition shows the point at which cinematic fantasy intersects with the desire for pure art on the basis of such montage techniques. In film, the techniques influenced each other in the 20th century through the collage works of Braque and Picasso, Mallarme’s poetry and Rodin’s sculpture, while in photography they established an independent genre. The flood of digital images has recently led to net-based montages made via the combination of various sources collected from the web, helping further expand the scope of montages. Ultimately, this event aims at a critical understanding of today’s social, political and cultural discourses raised by the amalgamation of fragments, such as painting, sculpture, installation, sound, video and computer games, that reflect the changed environment of art due to digitalization. Indeed, today’s montages go beyond a simple combination of individual cuts as shown by the existing films and photography. In addition, the exhibition is expected to provoke a cheerful but serious stirring of the imagination by dismantling the world in which we live and then assembling the fragments within the time and space encapsulated in a cinema.      Objectives of the Exhibition ▶ The exhibition offers viewers the opportunity to become completely immersed in the artists’ cheerful but serious imaginations that disassemble and reassemble the world in cinematic time and space within the white cube of an art gallery via the montage techniques of segmentation, juxtaposition, assemblage and combination.  ▶ The exhibition helps viewers experience a new cinematic form of modern art generated by amalgamating various elements of performance, sculpture, theater, film and still pictures that result in some of the most experimental and spectacular expressions of contemporary artists. ▶ The exhibition shows a special selection of montage films and guides viewers to the point where cinematic fantasy intersects with the desire for pure art via the montage techniques.

Accordingly, traditional sculpture has long tended to take the form of upright monuments. In the today’s art world, however, the tendency of genre deconstruction has become widespread leading to the boundary between the genres of sculpture and painting - that is three-dimensional and two-dimensional art forms - to become blurred. Artists of our time continue to conduct experiments, trying hard to free their work from the elements that have traditionally been regarded as the intrinsic attributes of sculpture, such as mass, gravity and monumentality. The works exhibited under the title, Against the Sculptural, raise questions about the attributes of sculpture and deconstruct the system that makes something a sculpture. They also give a brief overview of the phenomenon of installation art, the art of creating sculptural works in a fluid and indefinite form.             Today’s sculptors seek to avoid the upright monumental features and explore variable forms and concepts. As sculpture was first defined from the perspective of creating monuments, it seems only natural that artists today are attempting to deconstruct ‘the monument’. As such artists now employ various methods, such as hanging, piling, laying on the ground and fragmentation, which oppose the traditional desire for upright standing sculpture. They have also expanded the scope of the materials they use, including those that previously were regarded as unsuitable as proper sculptural materials, and in so doing have brought about changes to the heaviness, solidity, balance and uprightness of traditional sculpture via a variety of methods, such as softening, liquefaction, compression, expansion and condensation. It is through such efforts that modern sculptures have shifted from being a clearly defined mass to a changeable fluidic form. The works in this exhibition are expected to help grasp an aspect of the dramatic changes that have occurred in modern sculptural art, such as Process Art in which an artwork exists not as an end product but a process and Earth Art that uses a natural landscape as its material and canvas.   The works include sculptures that appear very fragile, as if composes of only skin. Yet they reveal or resist gravity, which is an uncontrollable power defining form. These sculptures reveal a harmony between an objet d'art and the objects that haven’t been treated as sculptural materials, such as air, wind and sound. Thus, here the emphasis has been placed on the deconstruction of traditional sculpting.    The artists behind the sculptures created them according to the properties of the materials used and the plastic theory of structures in order to construct narratives about the motives, means, and messages behind their deconstruction of traditional sculpting. The exhibition will be a great guide for the general art lover into a new world sculptures. One distinguished from the works of earlier generations via their escape from and the construction of the sculptures of their contemporary artists as well as the traditional sculptural forms and matters and the expression of private sensibility.  ○ Layout of the Exhibition Part 1.  Magnetic Field of Power - Anxiety  This exhibition features sculptures standing on a balance point of power via gravity and tension and works made to reveal or crack the balance and gravity, via the methods of hanging, leaning and moving, that have traditionally supported the art of sculpture. - Artists:   Part 2. Physical Imagination and Objects ? Worthlessness  Featured here are sculptures displaying a flattened, hollowed, softened or lightened body that have been made using seemingly worthless objects   Part 3. Vaporized Sculptures ? Liquidity  The sculptures shown here are in an evaporated, immaterial state, with almost no mass and volume, to display a matter-focused imagination and the temporariness and changeability of forms. This was achieved by using such elements as air, light and water. The works exhibit an important aspect of contemporary sculpting where everything evaporates, except for atmosphere, emotion or concept.

The exhibition is aimed to introduce viewers to multiple viewpoints to the sculpture of the human body via a collection of 27 works sculpted by 21 master artists. The works are carefully selected from a larger collection of sculptures owned by the museum to focus on the beauty of the human body.  Some insist that modern sculptural works of the human body are rather boring, but many art lovers are still easily attracted to the sculptures for the texture and movement of a material mass chosen for the works as well as the sensibility of the artists who carved them. As a social product and an expression of human sensibility, a work of art guides viewers to an understanding of what social influence has changed it just through a close look. The Seoul Museum of Art has a large collection of sculpture that has existed for a long period reflecting history, and it selected sculptural works of the human body featuring materials and techniques that can appeal to teenage viewers. The exhibition is expected to provide young viewers an opportunity to touch and feel the great three-dimensional works they have seen in art textbooks and have a memorable artistic experience.  ▣ Layout of the Exhibition and Participating Artists SectionⅠ. Warmth of Life This section exhibits works created by artists who are interested in the establishment of their own aesthetic world and identity via representation of human figures. It is true that modern human figure sculptures made by traditional techniques have been overshadowed by other diverse and exciting media of the postmodern period and tend to fail in attracting attention from both critics and general art lovers. The works collected for this exhibition, however, are worth rediscovering their value as a matrix for the development of sculpture and for a wealth of expressions contained in them.  Section Ⅱ. Hands That Touch and Feel  “What is real is not the external form, but the essence of things. … It is impossible for anyone to express anything essentially real by imitating its exterior surface.” (Constantin Brancusi) The works exhibited in this section are marked by the direct or indirect expression of abstractness, which is the language representing 20th century art, and interest in the material itself and the expression of the physical energy and characteristics of each material used for the works. These works are a revelation of temperance which is a profound reflection of the artists’ intention rather than their quest for artistic reality in a representational manner.  Section Ⅲ. Eyes Directed towards Tomorrow  The sculptural works in this section are characterized by the effort to transcend traditional forms and materials and use a great variety of experimental techniques, forms, and hybrid materials. The authors of the sculptures exhibited here tend not to be satisfied with the current tendency and continue to study hard to find their own plastic vocabulary.  This exhibition aims to help viewers have a comprehensive overview of the Korean history of sculpture in a macroscopic viewpoint via a collection of human figure sculptures created as a result of the artists’ aesthetic struggle. It is expected to give a particularly productive opportunity to young art lovers as many of these sculptures are great masterpieces they have seen in art textbooks, and they are accompanied by commentaries that arouse viewers’ interest and are easy to understand. The introduction of diverse sculptural materials and techniques as well as informative biographical and critical notes combined by famous works of sculpture are expected to create a sense of intimacy among young viewers towards art and the museum.  The exhibition is also accompanied by special educational programs specially designed to entertain children and teenagers and give them helpful art-related information, including “DIY Natural Soap Making” and “How to Make a Museum Tour Report,” and lecture programs aimed to nurture artistic creativity and increase general understanding of three-dimensional plastic art.

Crafts, Five Sounds” is a crafts exhibition taking place in five years in its kind since “Seoul Art Exhibition 2004”. And it is expected to offer the audience opportunity to review artistic changes and development of Korea’s recent crafts field in various angles. Based on the materials of crafts, the exhibition is composed of five sections of ceramics, metal crafts, lacquered woods, textile crafts and art glass, and sheds light to their individual materiality and practical, aesthetic value. On the other hand, artists’ inner message will make the audience to appreciate their agony and joy of creation behind each piece of art.      ","■ Seoul Museum of Art presents its 24th annual event, Handicraft, Five Sounds ? The Seoul Art Exhibition 2009, from October 9 to November 15. The works exhibited in the event are divided into several categories according to the scheme set up in 2004 including painting, sculpture, handicraft, and print. The guidelines of each event including the invitation of artists are decided through the meetings of the Exhibition Advisory Committee that the museum has operated since 2004 as part of the effort to secure maximum fairness and objectivity. The main focus of this year’s event will be placed on “handicraft” following last year’s “representation paintings.”  ■ Handicraft, Five Sounds ? The Seoul Art Exhibition 2009 is the first exhibition in five years, following The Seoul Art Exhibition 2004, that focused its attention on handicraft with an aim to offer museum goers a rare opportunity to experience a comprehensive overview of the changes and development of Korean modern arts and crafts from multiple points of view. Divided into five sections ? pottery, metalcraft, wooden lacquerware, textile, and glass, according to the materials used for the craft ? the exhibition sheds new light on the materiality of each medium and the practical and aesthetic values of each art form, and guides viewers to the hidden factors, such as pain and joy, behind a creative process displayed by the messages from the artisans’ inner world.  ■ The exhibition invited a total of 80 artists in their 40s to 60s who are widely regarded as masters representing each art genre they are engaged in. The artists have been devoted to amalgamation between aesthetic value and practical function of craftwork while surmounting the difficulties of maintaining the identity of handicraft as an art genre. They also played a leading role in the fight for the survival of handicraft and the establishment of its aestheticism. A closer look at the 130 handicraft items exhibited for the event will present viewers with a valuable opportunity to have a general overview of the handicraft, its glory in the past, its development during the modern period, and its artistic potential in the future.  ■ In Korea, handicraft has been closely related with everyday life in which it explored both functionality to meet the demands of daily life and the aesthetic value formed through the communication with various cultural aspects of the society. The origin of Korea’s modern handicraft can be found in the period of industrialization during which new concepts were formed and further developed under the influence of political and social heteronomy dominating the country. The development of Korean handicraft involved continued struggle to rediscover the value of handicraft as part of cultural heritage, art and industry in the specific historical and structural restrictions imposed by significant historical events such as the Japanese colonial rule and the Korean War. This event, held to provide a comprehensive overview of the growth process of Korean handicraft, will guide visitors to a reflection of Korean handicraft’s identity and prospects.   &gt;&gt; Details and participants by section  ■ Pottery Pottery is the art based on the primeval properties and the play element of earth. A work of pottery, featuring adequate form and weight that is created by heat of optimum temperature, displays warmth and composure resulting from the philosophy matured through earth, fire, and water. Pottery has prospered in a close relationship with daily life and aesthetic sensibility of humanity, maintaining the primal life force and value that developed with human history. Korean pottery today is greatly indebted to the achievement it made through history, and exhibits a great variety in its possibility, experimentation, and creativity based on the modern sensibility combined with traditional techniques.  Participating artists:   ■ Metalcraft Metalcraft represents the world of art marked by the harmony of heat and chill. Since humanity discovered the secret of extracting metal from ores dug from the ground, metal has played a crucial role in the development of human civilization, venting its energy for the creation of items used to display one’s social rank or wealth, religious symbols, objects of daily use, and the sublimation of creative instinct. The diverse techniques of metalcraft that involve striking, spreading, carving, and engraving ensure hardness and durability but require delicate and sure hand movements. As human civilization is still in the Metal Age, modern metalcraft continues to produce various objects that can satisfy the aesthetic sensibility of mankind.    ■ Wooden Lacquerware Wooden lacquerware is an art of giving form to wood, and finishing it with natural lacquer and ornamentations made of various materials. The lifecycle of a tree is often compared with the human life cycle, starting with birth and ending at death, and it is known to have a trait in communion with the emotion of human beings. In Korea, as in many parts of the world, wood has been one of the most easily attainable materials used to make various tools and structures required for daily life. It has also been a very important material used to make artwork and objects for practical purposes, including lacquerware items decorated with mother-of-pearl or ox-horn designs. Korea’s modern wooden lacquerware features delightfully simple forms and decorations marked by a great harmony between artificial and natural beauty.     ■ Textile Art Textile art refers to the arts and crafts that use plant, animal, or synthetic fibers to construct practical or decorative objects via the weaving, knitting, stitching and dyeing processes. The art, which includes embroidery, decorative knotting (maedeup), quilting, textile object, and others that make decorative and practical items through an elaborate process of handicraft, achieves a flexible harmony between a space and an object thanks to the variable function of wrapping, wearing, and covering things. The art of weaving with weft and warp threads has since long ago required women’s delicate hands and sensibility, but in the modern period it explores a much greater variety in the use of materials, skills and designs, producing works featuring a fine amalgamation between practicality and aestheticism.   ■ Glass Craft Glass craft is an art of making glass with sands or using glass as an artistic medium. Glass is born through a process of chemical change taking place in fire before fascinating viewers with transparency and brilliance comparable to those of the most precious gems. Widely regarded as one of the five greatest inventions in human history, glass has charmed humankind with fantastic and mysterious beauty since its birth some 2500 years ago. The glass works collected in this exhibition will help viewers discover a renewed sense of vitality and a profound emotional and spiritual satisfaction.  Background of the Event ■ Handicraft, Five Sounds ? The Seoul Art Exhibition 2009, the first exhibition to focus on handicraft after The Seoul Art Exhibition 2004, provides viewers with an opportunity to have a comprehensive overview of the artistic changes and various aspects of development in Korean modern handicraft. The exhibition consists of five sections focusing on pottery, metalcraft, wooden lacquerware, textile, and glass, divided according to the materials used for each craft genre. Viewers are offered an opportunity to have better understanding of the practical and aesthetic value of craftwork and original properties of the materials used for them and introduced to the background of each item, including the joy and pain the artists felt during the working process, told by the artists themselves.

Overview of the Event  ■ ■ Seoul Museum of Art presents City net Asia 2009, the fourth event to focus on Asian contemporary art, from September 30 to November 22. The event offers art lovers in Seoul with an overview of the latest trends in Asian art, which is fast rising to prominence in the international art market, and also explores the future and potential of said art. Launched as a biennial event of the Asian modern art project, the exhibition aims to introduce Asian contemporary art to the international art world, which has been dominated by the West, and to promote Asian art to the rest of the world. There have recently been a lot of exhibitions on Asian modern art led by young artists, guiding general art lovers from across the world towards the social reality and cultural identity of Asia.  The exhibition, City_net Asia, held at the Seoul Museum of Art, presents work by some of Asia’s better known artists. These pieces reflect various socio-cultural issues in modern day Asia and were selected by the curators of some of the major art museums of the major Asian cities. The works were chosen by the curators, in association with the contemporary artists, defined by their devotion to the identity of the Asian region to which they belong. The works are regarded as great examples that highlight the general trends in Asian contemporary art, and the presentation techniques and participating cities ensure that this event will remain very influential for some time to come.  The exhibition, City_net Asia 2009, will be participated in by the four art museums of the four major cities in Asia: the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, the Today Art Museum in Beijing, the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art in Istanbul and the Seoul Museum of Art in Seoul. It is expected that this exhibition will identify the future of Asian art via the works of young artists, based in the four cities mentioned above, as they grapple with the identity of their city of residence. As for the Seoul Museum of Art, the event will help the museum grow into a major art institution in the region and play a central role in the development of Asian contemporary art.   Natsumi Araki, the curator of the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, analyzes the characteristics of contemporary art in Tokyo in Off the Center ? Quiet Shift in Contemporary Art in Tokyo and also reflects on the new spirit of Tokyo’s handicraft seen through the works of a group of young Japanese artists interested in combining the elements of elaborate handicraft with various materials, such as wood, textile and plastics under the title. Araki brought for the Seoul exhibition a collection of about 20 works by nine young artists, who were born between 1960 and 1980, consisting of paintings, animations, mural paintings and large installations.  Li Xiaoqian, from the Today Art Museum in Beijing, China, focuses on the theme of Sedimentation and introduces the movement of the artists interested in the changes brought to Chinese society since it rapid industrialization. The title, Sedimentation, refers to the process whereby the interrelationship between atoms and the powers around them form matter that is divisible by its multiple layers. He points out that it is the resultant process and situation that arises from such a division that we need to pay attention to in Chinese contemporary art. His exhibition guides viewers through the latest works of 10 Chinese contemporary artists, whose main concern is not to directly comment on specific social issues. This does not mean, however, that the artists close their eyes and ears to the social issues around them because the fact is that they react more actively, if in a more composed manner, to the current social situation they find themselves a part of.    Levent Calikoglu, the head curator of the Istanbul Museum of Modern Art, guides viewers through a new art map linking Turkey’s dynamic contemporary art in the The New Continent: Istanbul exhibition. In other words, this exhibition provides a brief introduction of the contemporary art in Istanbul, focusing on how the works of Turkish contemporary art are related with music, film, politics and Turkish society and how they respond to each other. In the exhibition, viewers will be introduced to the videos and paintings of nine contemporary Turkish artists interested in linking Turkey’s urban reality with contemporary art in a novel manner.     The title of the event’s last section, Double Ax, refers to a paradoxical, double-edged situation in which an ax with double blades can become a threat either to me or to another according to the direction in which it is swung. The Korean contemporary art collected in this section display a sense of ambiguity; they exist on the boundary between two faces. The works feature a light form full of wit, in terms of theme and matter, while dealing with the important political and cultural issues facing Korean modern society. The exhibition consists of some 20 pieces by 10 artists based in Seoul.   The goal of the events organized by the curators is to provide Korean art lovers with a brief overview of the identity of four major Asian cities and the trends of contemporary art in Asia. The events of The City net Asia that have been held so far having gained a growing reputation and popularity among curators and artists across Asia.

152,116,Age of Monsters - Dissonant Visions,,"Seoul Museum of Art, Exhibition Room 1 (1st floor at main building)",2009-06-24,2009-08-30,,,,,,Overall contemporary Art, 60 pieces ,,,"This exhibition aims to introduce general art lovers to various interpretations of modern art focused on monsters, the fantastic creatures made by artists’ wild imagination.   Artists have continued to exploit their wild imagination since very long ago to create monsters that can stimulate the imagination of their viewers. Then and now, they preferred using monster metaphors to represent in their work the discord from the conflict between the current world and the value of individual people, refusal or violation of the existing order and systems, and the disharmony between the one’s original self and the self imposed by society. It is generally agreed that one of the most significant hidden codes to help read the diverse trends of today’s art world that keeps on changing at an alarming speed is “dissonance,” which appears as a monster of our time. That is why the works by 21 artists collected for this exhibition under the title, Dissonant Visions, can be united by a single common denominator. The word “monster” came from two Lain words, “monstrare” (literally meaning “to show”) and ‘monere’ (literally “to warn”). The origin of the word reveals that monster had referred, at least before the 19th century, to a human being who should be a warning for all through revelation of his vice, madness, unreason, violation, or other spiritual or moral deviation rather than something visually ugly or fearful. A monster was not something created naturally but by modern knowledge based on human culture and art which is also a creature represented as the other in the historical context of the time. Monstrousness has gradually been expressed by the image of mankind who lost control over the world, as it becomes more and more difficult for modern people to know what is good and what is bad and hence what should be expressed as a monster. Today we face increasing instability of human existence, disastrous reality of the modern society, and uncertainty about the future while traditional rational order and value continue to suffer a state of confusion in this “hybrid” world. The exhibition is expected to offer an opportunity to reflect upon the inhumane brutality which exists in the depth of modern people through the shapes of monsters that appear before us in a greater variety in modern painting.   Contents and Participants by Section   This exhibition aims to help viewers escape from the traditional preconception of a monster or what is monstrous, and expand the horizon of their imagination to make new, diverse interpretations of the monster and the modern world. The exhibition is participated in by 21 artists and their works, featuring a great diversity in terms of materials, forms, and contents, including painting, photography, sculpture, installation and video, that are divided into three sections according to theme.  Section 1. The Revelation of Dystopia  The works collected in this section are characterized by the rhetoric of monstrousness with which the artists look at the depression of their time as a revelational response to the disastrous reality of modern society. The themes of the works include despair and horror about the absurdity and illness of the world, discomfort and pessimism about civilized society and the inhuman brutality hidden inside it, and uncertainty of the future society vulnerable to the uncontrollable change in science and technology.   Section 2. Forbidden Land  The works in this section are focused on the meaning of monsters as a being that refuses to accept the traditional values and prejudices of existing human society and violates its rules. The creatures that violate taboos in these works feature aspects of a monster as if to represent Foucault’s definition of the monster as a union between impossibility and taboo. The monster depicted here is, in short, a creature standing on, or crossing, the boundary between two irreconcilable worlds. The modern world is the world of hybrids ? marked by the breach of the rules of nature, mixture between species, and confusion of boundaries and characteristics ? and disturbs the existing order and values based on reason by revealing its monstrous aspects represented by hybrids.  Section 3. The Monster Inside Me  The works in this section deal with the dark side of human nature and madness. Art is an aesthetic expression of a time, an artist’s statement on his or her perception of social reality, and a result of his or her exploration of the inner essence of mankind. What is depicted in these works may be the horror about being in the depth of human mind, the artist’s alter ego, or a psychological self-portrait of all of us. A closer look at these works may help viewers find the monster lurking inside them.

151,114,Renoir: Promise of Happiness,,"Seoul Museum of Art, 2nd, 3rd",2009-05-28,2009-09-13,http://www.renoirseoul.com,,"Organized by Seoul Museum of Art, Hankook Ilbo, and SBS / Sponsored by Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Korea National Tourism Organization, and Ambassade de France en Coree",Weekdays 10 am to 9 pm / Weekends and holidays 10 am to 8 pm,,,,,,"▶▷ A Forerunner of Impressionism: Art of Sensuality and Joy  Hankook Ilbo, Korea’s leading daily newspaper, has been widely praised by Korean art lovers for organizing major exhibitions focused on some of the world’s greatest modern artists such as Chagall (2004), Picasso (2006), Monet (2007), and van Gogh (2007-2008). This year, Hankook Ilbo jointly presents with Seoul Museum of Art and SBS a collection of paintings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919), a forerunner of Impressionist art and one of the world’s most beloved artists whose paintings focus on sensuality and joy. The event takes place from May 28 to September 13, 2009.   Renoir is often cited as the only figure of all the masters who lived through art’s turbulent era of the late 19th century but took up no tragic themes for his art. He believed that a painting should be “joyful, cheerful and beautiful,” and left over 5,000 oil paintings depicting the joy and delight of life via a fusion of colors and light.  Held as Korea’s first retrospective exhibition on the works of Renoir, the event guides art lovers to the true meaning of happiness in daily life in which the exuberance of light and colors expel darkness of our turbulent world. Visitors to the exhibition will be offered a rare opportunity to have a delightful journey into happiness captured by a master who believed that “a painting should be a gift of joy that cleanses the soul of mankind.”  ▶▷ An Impressionist Master Who Left the World’s Most Beautiful Paintings  “A painting should be something that pleases the viewer’s eyes.”  Paintings by Renoir are not just simple depictions or representations of a scene capturing transient effects of light. His paintings are, first of all, something that entertains viewers and their eyes. His paintings are joy and happiness of life in the expression of contemporary life or classical beauty of sensuality, as “life is an eternal holiday.” Happiness that one encounters through the world’s most beautiful paintings -- that is the promise of the Renoir’s paintings.  “Renoir’s First Retrospective Exhibition in Korea” This event is Korea’s third major exhibition focused on the art of Impressionist masters following that of Monet (420,000) in 2007 and van Gogh (810,000) in 2008, and the first exhibition devoted to the art of Renoir. With the works of this great Impressionist painter who remains one of the most popular artists across the world today, the exhibition is expected to offer a great opportunity to expand the base of the Korean art world and increase the number of art lovers in the country.  “The Largest Renoir Exhibition Ever” This year’s exhibition in Seoul is known to be the largest Renoir exhibition in terms of quality and quantity after his retrospective exhibition held in 1985 at Grand Palais in Paris. The collection of about 120 works by Renoir are collected from some of the world’s most prestigious museums such as the Musee d'Orsay, Musee de l'Orangerie, and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. For Korean art lovers, this exhibition is expected to be the only opportunity to get direct access to the essence of the Renoir art.  “Exhibition of the Largest Number of Oil Paintings in Korea” Among the 118 works collected for this event, over 70 are oil paintings, making it the largest exhibition of oil painting ever held in Korea. Over 30 of them are works largely regarded as masterpieces, and naturally the exhibition will be a momentous event for those who are interested in the art world of Renoir.  Exhibition for the Greatest Masterpieces The works to be shown in the exhibition include some of the most loved works among general art lovers and masterpieces representing the Impressionist movement and each stage of the Renoir’s art, such as The Country Dance (1883), The Swing (1876), Nude in the Sun (1875-1876), Girls at the Piano (1892), and Claude Renoir in Clown Costume (1909). The works are expected to guide viewers to the very heart of the Impressionist art world explored by Renoir.  “A Huge Collection of 118 Paintings in One Place” Held as Korea’s first Renoir exhibition, this great art event presents a huge collection of 118 works gathered from individual collectors and over 40 public museums across the world including the Musee d'Orsay and Musee de l'Orangerie, home to many of the greatest Impressionist masterpieces. The works are arranged according to period and theme to cover the entire gamut of Renoir’s artistic achievement from the earliest to the final stage of his art, guiding viewers to a comprehensive overview of Renoir’s art world. The event is generally regarded as the largest Renoir exhibition since the retrospective exhibition held in 1985 at Grand Palais in Paris. A larger number of works are figure paintings including nude paintings capturing bathing women which are often considered as forming the pinnacle of his art. Overview of the Exhibition The exhibition consists of 8 sections arranged according to themes and designed to help viewers have a comprehensive understanding of Renoir’s art world. The first section, “Happiness of Daily Life,” exhibits colorful works depicting beautiful women, lovely children, and others all wearing happy smiles on their faces. It is then followed by “Family Portraits” (Section 2), “Women’s Images” (Section 3), and “Bathing Women and Nudity” (Section 4) which is highlighted by the paintings of beautiful women displaying a voluptuous, sensual body that characterizes the classical beauty of perfection in Renoir’s art. The paintings of “Renoir and His Art Dealers” in the fifth section are focused on the relationship between the artist and his art dealers ? Durand-Ruel, Bernheim-Jeune and Vollard ? while the “Landscapes and Still Lifes” in Section 6 capture attractive natural landscapes that played a crucial role in the birth of Impressionism. The last two sections consist of the “Renoir’s Works on Paper” (Section 7) and portraits of “Renoir Painted by Albert Andre” (Section 8).

150,113,"Attack the Museum! Art space seized by monsters, tanks, animals, and toys",,Outdoor spaces at SeMA including main building front yard and garden ,2009-04-30,2009-06-14,,,,10:00am ~ 21:00pm,FREE,,,,,"▶▷A new exhibition, “Attack the Museum! - Museum Visit in Spring” takes place at an outdoor space around the main hall of Seoul Museum of Art from April 30 to June 14. Organized as part of the celebration for National Family Month and the Hi Seoul Festival, the exhibition will be held at several different venues including those in the museum’s front yard, garden, and entrance road. It was launched in 2004 as a special event and has since been held annually under different themes, providing general museum goers with an opportunity for exciting cultural experiences and refreshments. This year’s event, held under the title “Attack the Museum!”, presents collections designed for pleasant artistic communication with citizens visiting the museum to spend a more pleasant springtime.  ★”Attack the Museum! ? Museum Visit in Spring 2009” Popular cartoon images seized all the open space outside the art museum in an event called “Attack the Gas Station!” Art lovers are invited to the site where the cheerful assault took place.  Conceived from the imagination of the enthusiasts in fine art, animation, wooden figure models, and cartoon characters, this exhibition is open to all, creating an exciting festival in which art museum space is integrated with non-mainstream culture.  ▣ Wild imagination and cartoon images ? A sudden assault of the non-mainstream culture  “Art museum and a sudden assault”: what on earth does this ill-matched combination try to show? With a title conceived from a successful Korean film, Attack the Gas Station!, this exhibition, Attack the Museum!, is based on a concept that a collection of delightful works of art made from wild imagination occupy all the corners of the museum. What is wild imagination then? It is the imagination of enthusiasts who have an obsession with their own world or something they are fond of. They tend to feel pressed into roles as “economic animals” in a society of severe competition, but easily escape into a fantasy developed in their own world. They spend a lot of time, even more time than that required for their livelihood, to find stories and characters in video games and cartoons which they use as their own materials to recreate new icons via modification and adaptation. Cultural phenomena such as this exert a powerful influence upon young artists through exchange with so called “highbrow culture.” The modified use of styles and stories taken from other art genres are now very commonly found, forming an axis of contemporary art.  ▣ Art museum and attack ? Reserved occupation The goal of Attack the Museum! is to attack the stronghold of highbrow art based on the non-mainstream concept, although in the reserved manner of images commonly seen in cartoons. Therefore, visitors to the museum will be met by works which look much like toys and products of cartoonist imagination. Much of the space outside the museum is occupied by tanks, unidentifiable monsters, animals, artist’s figures, and heroic characters lurking here and there as if waiting for a chance to break into the interior of the museum. These creatures are in fact non-mainstream art works estranged from the central stage of art rather than fearful attackers armed with lethal weapons. They encircled the art museum, a symbol of elite art world, and are poised to start an attack in an attractive, rather than detestable, manner.   A monster perched on the roof of the museum fa?ade appears comical and far from being scary. A closer look at a tank crouching near the museum either to guard or attack it reveals that it is in fact a “Banana-flavored Milk Tank,” presenting the artist’s concept that the banana-flavored milk is distributed to meet the criteria of the mainstream West. The “Men in Suits” standing in line around the museum’s main entrance like guards display the appearance of ordinary office workers although there is something weird around them. A group of animals found their place at the museum’s garden packed with high-priced works of art, as if having “Tea Time,” while the “Cloud Man” with legs grown from clouds tries a safe landing on the museum. The word “attack” used here is not an offensive action taken to hurt others but a humorous and comic one in which creatures that can’t be related with a museum in any way suddenly develop into art works and storm the museum. Viewers generally feel that they have seen, and are even familiar with, these works of cartoon images gathered in the museum, but at the same time viewers find that there is some strangeness about them as they seem to appear as commercial products or animation characters.  ▣ What is an attack? ? From occupation to joint ownership  The event, Attack the Museum!, aims at delivering joy and delight to art lovers through art, helping them overcome any despair they might suffer from the current economic recession. The “attack” in this exhibition refers to an action through which such creatures as cartoons, artist’s figures, toys, and others born from some enthusiasts’ imagination seize a museum that deals only with solid and sacred “high art.” Similarly, the word, also closely related with occupation or seizure, makes us redefine the meaning of museum space. With the word, the concept of a museum as a sacred space owning or owned by art works develops into that referring to a space open to, and shared by, non-mainstream culture formed via the “maniac imagination” in art. Such a development dims the boundary between mainstream and non-mainstream, low culture and high culture, and winner and loser. The exciting attack eventually causes viewers to question whether their hero is in fact an intruder or the creatures they regard as intruding monsters are in fact their guardian deities. This transforms the museum as a space for elites into an open space where all kinds of wild imaginations gather and prosper together. As a result, the event in which it is not clear who attacks whom and no clear boundary exists between cheerfulness and cheerlessness becomes an exciting festival in which people of all backgrounds are mixed with each other.  ▣ Information on the main artists participating in the event Open to exhibit works unreserved in traveling across popular culture, cartoonist imagination and art, this exhibition is participated in by artists who freely cross the borders between several different artistic and industrial genres including design, advertisement, and animation. The artists include: Young Kim, a Korean American artist who has been active in the U.S. via various art directing and installation art projects with works based on the portraits and characters of the artist himself; Sticky Monster Lab, a group of artists engaged in multiple art genres such as digital animation, figure and illustration with characters known as Monsters; and Hwang Eun-jeong who is based in the U.S. and Germany and gaining reputation with works involving animation of various characters, Future Creatures, created by the artist.

The event grew into an international event in 2002 when the organizer increased the number of participants and prize money as well as its outreach to the international art world. It has since then played a substantial role in increasing the popularity of art prints among general art lovers, and developed into Korea’s leading international event of its kind.

160,111,New Acquisitions 2008,,"Seoul Museum of Art, 2nd",2009-04-03,2009-05-05,,,,"Time of display: 10 a.m. ? 9 p.m. on weekdays, ",,,,,,"○ One of the core activities of the Seoul Museum of Art is the acquisition of new artwork. The museum’s efforts in this regard have so far helped it to amass a vast collection of 2507 art pieces. While this is a remarkable achievement, the museum continues to use its resources to completing the collections of various artists or periods in Korean art history.  ○ It was as part of its acquisition project that the museum purchased the works by Gwon Ok-yeon, Yi Jun, Yi Eung-no, Jeon Roe-jin, Ha Jong-hyeon, Choe Jong-tae, O Seung-u, Kim Bong-tae, Yi Gyu-seon, Park Gwang-jin, Kim Gu-rim, Yeo Un, Park Sang-suk and others. The works of these artists had already been collected by the museum, but the collection was not sufficient to show the development of the artists by style or period. This meant that the museum needed to continue to purchase their works to supplement the existing collections and thus better explain the periods of change. As these artists occupy center stage in the history of Korean modern art and exerted a strong influence upon it, broader collections of their work will give a clearer picture of the development of Korean art. As for Autumn (秋, 1968), by Yi Jun, which was one of the museum’s most recent purchases, for instance, experts regard it to be a crucial work in explaining his transition to geometric abstraction.      ○ The most important means of completing the museum’s collections has been through the purchase of the works it requires; however, the other equally important source to perfecting its collections is via donations. The donation of the works of some of Korea’s master artists, such as Park No-su, Gwon Yeong-u and Choe Deok-hyu, played, in fact, a crucial role in enhancing the quality and quantity of the museum’s collections of these artists. In 2008, other important donations were made to the museum.  ○ The 2008 donations consisted of 45 photographs by Yuk Myeong-sim, collected under The Artist Series, and 35 paintings by Oh Seung-u, which included the paintings of the Ten Creatures of Longevity, landscapes depicting some scenic sites in Korea and renowned overseas Buddhist temples. The photographs of The Artist Series are portraits of some of Korea’s most admired artists, poets and Gugak musicians, including Kim Gi-chang, Yi Jong-u, O Ji-ho, Seo Jeong-ju, Park Mok-wol, Hwang Sun-won and Hwang Byeong-gi. The photographs are currently on exhibition in the museum’s Namseoul Gallery. The museum also made great efforts to achieve a balance between art genres by collecting the textiles of Yi Sin-ja, the ceramics of Yi Heon-guk and the calligraphy of Yi Su-deok.    ○ Some of the works were collected via online subscriptions, including paintings by Choe Yeong-geol, Kim In-tae, Hwang Yong-jin, Seo Jeong-tae, Son Su-gwang, Gwon Gi-beom, Sin Geum-nye, Jeong Jin-yong, Hong Jae-yeon, Gang Jin-sik, Ha Gwan-sik, Hwang Hye-seon, Jo Mun-ja and Yi Jeong-ji, while others, including the works by Cha U-hi, Go San-geum, Jeong So-yeon, Park Seok-hwan and Yun Ae-yeong, were collected via the museum’s special art shows. The museum has also collected sculptural works for open-air exhibitions: Hand of Promise II by Gang Hi-deok on display in the sculptural park of Seoul Forest and Samgeunmok 2 by Yi Gil-rae resides in the open-air sculpture park of Nanji Studio.  ○ A lack of exhibition space led the museum to divide the collection into several sections according to genre and to display them in turn. The first exhibition under the new system will be entitled New Acquisitions 2008, and the museum expects it to be an effective report of their acquisition activities up to now for art lovers visiting the museum.

114,110,Art and Synesthesia,,"1F Main Building, Seoul Museum of Art",2009-03-18,2009-06-07,,,,,,,,,,"With its title, Art and Synesthesia, inspired by the synesthetic art that gained brief popularity in the Western art world between the late 16th to early 17th century, the exhibition displays a collection of paintings showing aspects of the senses of not only vision but of hearing, smell, touch, and taste, and the tendency of synesthesia in which all the senses are linked with each other.   While the traditional synesthetic paintings were interested in didactic presentation of the evanescence and futility of senses depending on the objects symbolizing the senses, today’s paintings reveal that synesthesia is used as a tool to give inspiration and imagination to the making and viewing of the works. These works guide viewers to an inquiry into how the tendency of synesthesia which continues to be discussed in literature and art as a form of special ability or universal perception and as a socio-political code appears or is materialized in today’s art, and how it becomes the source of the artists’ imagination.   The exhibition consists of two sections. The works collected under the first section, “I. Sensory Illusions,” show that viewers can experience transition and association of other senses in a painting which is traditionally regarded as an art form requiring only the viewer’s vision. The paintings of the second section, “I. Multiple Sense: Crossing and Blending,” lead viewers to a new aesthetic experience by stimulating the senses of hearing, touch, smell, and taste in a multiple manner and an interaction between the artworks and viewers.  The exhibition is expected to offer viewers an opportunity to get over the traditional prejudice that a work of art is there only to be seen and, instead, to feel and experience it in a new context. In addition, modern art, while it tends to be regarded as having become too difficult and complex to access due to the diversified use of media, can become more communicative due to the exhibition’s function of exciting multiple senses and multi-faceted sensibility. The event will also lead viewers to an aspect of the discourse or phenomenon of today’s art where there is no single answer due to the synesthesia that defy the causal relationship of one-to-one correspondence.   ■ Participating Artists   “I.

115,109,Photography for Reading and Photography for Feeling ,,SeMA Namseoul Annex Building,2009-03-06,2009-05-24,,,,,,,,■ 서울시립미술관 소장품-사진,,"Photographs Read, Photographs Sensed   The history of the camera is traced back for more than one century already. As high-performance digital cameras rapidly spread recently, the camera is no longer a luxurious item for the general public. By using this camera, we capture all objects in our daily lives. The photographic images we have taken are shared by all through online mediums. As we grow gradually more interested in photography, photography is given with another meaning beyond the function of simple recording through the processes of modifying and editing images.   Along with this social phenomenon, in a recent few years, mid-career blue-chip photographers in their 40s and 50s distinguish themselves through their international activities. Photographic theoreticians who studied abroad debate issues of photographic art. The major art museums at home and abroad often hold enormous scale photographic exhibitions to shed light on the true nature of photographic art, and primary galleries and collectors purchase photographic works at high prices. This exhibition aims to raise productive discourses on contemporary art by embracing, reading, feeling, and communicating with photographs from new perspectives, departing from the previous point of view.  If briefly reviewing the history of Korean photography, in modern Korean photography an idea was to pursue its independent existence and value to escape from painting. The theories of modern photographic aesthetics were able to keep photography from external impeachment, but they sometimes hampered the expansion of a photographic sphere and improvement of liberal expression. In the 1960s, contemporary photography began refusing all restrictions, embracing new perception and senses that are unimaginable from established perspectives and techniques. The standard to interpret reality and the senses to feel objects have changed. At that time, journalist-turned-photographers and amateur photographers entered in artistic work and continued their artistic photographs up to the 70s and 80s. Directly or indirectly influenced by the conceptions of contemporary photography that addressed a wide variety of photographic genres such as documentary photos, portrait photos, commercial photos, and celebrity photos, they grew and discussed the contact point of photography and art.  Since the mid-1990s, young contemporary artists in the fields of painting and sculpture were captivated by photography's mechanism and documentary quality and thus actively exploited it for their work. Their works were displayed at major museums and large-scale galleries. It is recorded as a significant turning point in the history of contemporary Korean photography. The tendencies photography accepted other genres and other genres embraced photography appeared from the late 1990s up to today. Photographs produced through diverse mediums and techniques opened up a new horizon in contemporary photographic art. Since then, contemporary Korean photography was not regarded as something separate from contemporary art but is seen as an extension of contemporary art, forming the forum for productive discourse.  In this show outstanding artworks by eminent photographers are diversely recomposed and displayed. This exhibition is meaningful in that it aims to enhance the viewers' understanding of contemporary photography by providing them with the opportunity to have a new perception of it and to shift their conception.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_b28541732a364e958cec393016f384c2_db521d04d8cf467b8eeae99aa9ea9779,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=115,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
113,108,Seoul Art Exhibition 2008,the currents of Korea's modern figurative painting,"1F Main Building, Seoul Museum of Art",2008-12-20,2009-02-22,,,,,,,,,,"■  The Seoul Museum of Art (SeMA) hosts the 23th &lt;Seoul Art Exhibition 2008-the currents of Korea's modern figurative painting-&gt; from December 20, 2008 to February 22, 2009. As an annual event since 1985, the exhibition has progressed into specifying such concrete genres as paintings, sculptures, ceramics, and prints on display. This year's show focuses on figurative painting, following the last year's print. ■ To bring the currents of modern figurative painting in Korea to light, the exhibition displays the works of 68 actively working domestic painters of the ages of 50s and ups. Distant from realistic paintings common in young generations, their paintings will provide an opportunity to reveal typical characteristics deeply rooted in traditional styles of Korea's contemporary figurative paintings. ■ Often illustrating opposite concepts of abstract art, figurative painting can make it possible to check various inner aspects of the figurative frameworks. This year's exhibition tries to go beyond the conceptual issues of the genre and inspect diverse trends focusing on actual circumstances by providing three sessions on the show: &lt;Representation and Existence&gt;, &lt;Transformation and Formality&gt;, and &lt;Everyday lives and Illusions&gt;. &lt;Representation and Existence&gt; puts more emphasis on attitudes faithful to objects and being on spot. While some attempt to lift up moulding values of representation, others try to achieve unity with nature, in which the ways to personalism often lie behind through strongly expressed elements. &lt;Transformation and Formality&gt; stands out that the expression of subjectivity overwhelms nature or objects somehow or other. Because these paintings reflect the painters' emotional reactions to nature or objects rather than factual descriptions, they tend to overexaggerate, modify, or omit dramatically, which could be called an expressive attitude or phase. The phase transcending this to pursuing a painter' unique plastic art could obviously reach conventionalization. Exposing Hyperrealism which first appeared as intensive reactions to objects and has spread out widely among young generations since then, &lt;Everyday Lives and Illusions&gt; uncovers evolved forms of common lives into fantasy while displaying incisive sensuous responses to everyday lives. ■ With regards to the distribution pattern of the painters, figurative painters outnumber others which is usual in other countries as well. Unfortunately, since the advent of abstract art in 1960s, figurative painting has not established its domains well enough. Although it includes not only the majority of paintings but also various types of concepts, the lack of positive evaluation of it might result from the lack of efforts to discover and develop multifaceted factors. Holding 100th anniversary of western painting's introduction into Korea, inspecting current aspects of figurative painting and the basis of western paintings, will surely be a stepping-stone of strengthening unique identity of Korean art.

112,107,Ancient Futures,,SeMA Namseoul Annex Building,2008-12-11,2009-02-15,,,,,,,,,,"Description of the Exhibition:  ■ Exhibition titled &lt;Ancient Futures&gt; held at Seoul Museum of Art is to explore a relationship between environment, nature and human from different perspectives. Ancient Future, a title adopted from the title of the essay by Helena Norberg Hodge, linguist and crusader, is a suggestion to look upon the present and future of contemporary arts based upon its long tradition pursuing the progress of mankind.  ■Ancient Future is to prospect philosophical and aesthetic reflections on environment, nature and human with questions for value of the life: nature manipulated by the human and boundaries between nature and art, life and death, the real and the false, the cyclic and the acyclic, in social and psychological manners beyond a simple representation of ecological nature. The keywords like circulation-community-organic contact-desire-hybrid utopia, Eros and Thanatos, uncomfortable scenes throw questions about our existence creatures in the environment.   ■ This exhibition provides opportunities to recognize extended meanings of environment, a space which is essential as a filed of life, to view the cultural dimension: relations between animals and plants, the geographical history of places and changing socio-ecological relations. In the process of humans achieving material wellbeing based on a human-oriented perspective, they have been destroying ecology which is the basis of life. The effort of humans to realize utopia by conquering nature was followed by the ruined ecology, contamination and exhaustion of resources while justifying their domination over nature due to their anxiety for progression, and the overwhelming nature with artificially modified or transplanted man-created environment changed the life of humans and all the other creatures. The modified nature has occurred not only physical change but the change of mentality. A human desire to control the life by gaining the blueprint of life is obviously a point to blur the division between the living and the nonliving thing. A readily transplanted man-made nature to copy, mix and match the basic nature is eventually a place which appears as if a theater stage under construction where actors are trying to make up a series of stories but the ending is depending on the audience. Thus, the audience gets to experience environment as a creature and nature artificially modified to be replaced with mutants by preferences by being invited to the exhibition room divided on the 1st and 2nd floor to stage the time based narratives. It is somewhat to experience the time and history which flows from utopia to dystopia by metaphors just as a play, as well as a gesture to emphasize on reality mixed with life and death, nature and art and the real and the false. ■ Throughout various perspectives to examine the relation between nature and human beings, Ancient Future views the interdependent relationship among arts, environment, nature and humans. Accordingly, it is expected to look upon the lost value in suggestions though aesthetically and socially multilateral gazes.

110,106,The 2008 Centre Georges Pompidou Exhibition 'Heaven for Artists,,"Seoul Museum of Art, 2nd, 3rd",2008-11-22,2009-03-22,,,,,,,,,,"&lt;The 2008 Centre Georges Pompidou Exhibition &quot;Heaven for Artists&quot;&gt; under the theme of 'Arcadia' concept  presents how 'the images of heaven' were expressed and analyzed in contemporary ways by European artists around Paris after the 20th century by looking deeply into the relationship between their mythology, history, and literature. Arranged by Didier Ottinger, chief curator of the Centre Georges Pompidou, this exhibition includes 79 master pieces of collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou in several different genres such as paintings, installations, and visual arts, which have never been exhibited in Korea. The exhibition is classified into 10 small themes including 'Golden Age,' 'Joy,' 'Messenger,' 'Harmony,' Darkness.' 'Recovered Arcadia' and 'Lunch on the Grass.' It gives specific image of heaven in the western culture illuminated by modern artists. The word 'Arcadia' refers to an actual region in the middle of Greece but was depicted as a blessed affluent land by the Latin culture as well as Virgil, a poet in ancient Rome. It implies an imaginary world, a heaven of fantasy full of shepherds enjoying music, thus portraying an idealized fictional world of heaven. Arcadia, meaning the ideal that human beings are dreaming of was often described as the Golden age or Paradise and after the 16th century, western people called it 'Utopia' which can be compared with 'Moo-Leung-Do-Won(武陵挑源)' in the Asian tradition. Especially the meaning was driven by &lt;&lt;The Arcadian Shepherds (Les Bergers d’Arcadie)&gt;&gt; by Nicolas Poussin known as the founder of the France classical painting. The subtitle 'Even in Arcadia I exist' meaning 'even in heaven, death exists' represents the 'heaven' as a place where the boundary between life and death is vague. Therefore, it can be seen that the heaven which used to be the symbol of abundance in the Golden age was changed to an extensive root for examining conscience of human beings. This exhibition not only gives a chance to appreciate the best 39 modern artists ranging from the 20th century artists including Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Miro, to the contemporary artists including Yves Klein, Gary Hill, but also to take a look into the changes of spiritual flow revealed in the Western culture after the 20th century.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_92fdeb023f884afda52a0f622ac345e0_1ab3538e3de441729f7d8b4cd5f7504b,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=110,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
109,105,Reading the boundary between fiction and nonfiction,,Nam Seoul Annex Building of Seoul Museum of Art,2008-10-15,2008-11-30,,,,,,,,,,"As we welcome the autumn, best season for reading books, we present the 'Reading Fine Arts' as a way of appreciating the arts.  ‘Reading Fine Arts’ introduces the readers of how the artists’ literary concepts are conveyed to the galleryites, creating a bond between them. It also shows the method of ‘art reading’ that starts with the understanding of the conceptualized art and how other artists’ works express their unique visions.     This exhibition presents artworks that reveal the artists' sensibility and tries to disturb the boundary line between reality and unreality, fiction and nonfiction, the concept and the image. It is possible to record reality intentionally based on the fact that photograph and visual media are not just tools that record images. They now can control and create entirely new situations. This phenomenon is not simply drawn from the characteristics of the media but it is also from the attempts of the artists to pull up the hidden stories formed under the multi-dimensional culture and social structures in 21st century, expressing it on their works with their sensibility.  The main issue in this exhibition is the interchangeable relationship between 'real' and 'surreal'. It includes the artists who focus on the line between fiction and non-fiction and artworks shown the vagueness between them. Recently it has become possible that a documentary with photographs and images can be connected with a fiction, recreating a new meaning above personal, social, and historical issues and can be analyzed in various directions. This attempt is introduced as the diversity of reality through the cooperation between the use of media and the genre. For instance, the meaning of 'installation' as an extended area of a sculpture is not just to present an objet by such a method, but as a result, it is the reflection of reality showing through the relationship between the representation territory and its suggestive situation. Thus, it makes possible to surpass the state of reality or irregularities through the presented mise-en-scene in documentary or its images. It is intended in this exhibition to look into this process of arts with the views in 'fiction and non-fiction.' Suggesting the witty examples to watch and analyze an object, this exhibition is to offer a chance to understand the meaning of fiction in fine arts, and to step back and forth across the line between fiction and non-fiction in an interesting way. Recently, the discussions about the lines between media and between genres have been on the rise. Reality and fiction, two and three dimensions, and 'reality and simularc' have been dealt in different directions and this attempt has shown and reformed the arts in cooperation with a variety of genres. In this moment, this exhibition is set up for a chance to think about these issues in various ways through the artists' own styles shown on their artworks.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_6ddd9cec107043eba812501953e7f821_9aca6a87b18540209eca28893f85d757,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=109,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

While most media art exhibitions are held once, the Seoul International Media Art Biennale starting from 2000 and opening the 5th this year has become one of the remarkable Media Art Biennales in and outside the country serving as a stage for keeping the alive history of media art. Particularly this 5th Biennale is based on the theme 'Turn and Widen,' paying attention to the aspect that the advent of media art and its fashion have derived new media into the field of art, and it has turned into a new form, and it caused the area of art experience to be changed and extended. Thus, this Biennale is aimed to find answers through a variety of exhibits to those fundamental, essential questions; What is media art? What is different from the conventional art? What changes have been made by that in the field of art? and what influences could come from now? Based on this direction and critical mind above, the Biennale classifies the difference between traditional and media art in three points of view, and accordingly the exhibition is divided into three parts. The first part, the field of light.  This part shows the changes of the state of art. Instead of the stage of using natural light and analyzing it, the changes by the advent of lights using the advanced technologies have revealed through artworks created by utilizing lights and by composing the environment through them such as neon-art, light kinetic, laser art, and hologram. It is represented how the images and effects of light presented by electromagnetic waves are expressed in the work and the changes they could draw. The second part, the field of communication. The second part focuses on the changes of the communication methods in work of art. As the traditional art was built on the concept of the observation or passive participation by spectators, interactive art has emerged in the field of media art that the spectators take an active part to modulate and complete the works. Also the effort to give a variety of multi-sided experiences to the spectators not only with the visual aspect, but also auditory and tactile senses has been made. Furthermore, virtual reality has been drawn into artworks which show the changes of the perception of reality treated through the artworks. The third part, the field of time. By the emergence of artworks using computer and video, there has been an extension of the boundary of art which used to be defined as spatial art. In addition, the works involving the concept of time have appeared. This part includes video arts and animations in attempts to unfold a story in time, artworks containing a motion using a new technology and those under the motive of the changing images with the flow of time.  ■ Exhibiting Artists 80 artists, 66 teams from 25 countries (11 teams from Korea, 55 teams from abroad)  ■ Free entry -We manage the extension of the “Admission-free Day” for the Seoul International Media Art Biennale.

Under the theme of &quot;Seeing&quot; or &quot;Visual Perception&quot; the exhibition is designed to allow viewers to actively participate in various visual perception activities, experience art as an amusement or pleasure, and at the same time provide an opportunity to expand the breadth of their scientific, philosophical thoughts.   In this show, like both scientists and alchemists have done, participating artists bring about fantastic spaces by using techniques and various apparatus for exploring and exploiting the fallibility of the eye like those found in many visual puzzles and thus, viewers can experience a fantastic world beyond the limits of visual perception. This world is merely what our eyes intend to discover.

102,101,Korean Abstract Art : 1958-2008,,"Seoul Museum of Art, 2nd, 3rd",2008-07-09,2008-08-23,,,,,,,,,,"The exhibition of the Korean abstract art; 1958-2008 aims to look back art made by Korean artists between 1958 and 2008 when the Korean modern art has been in full flourish, and to anticipate the future of the Korean abstract art. This exhibition is also designed to celebrate the 20th anniversary of opening the Seoul Museum of Art in 2008.  In the special exhibition art generated in the half century of the Korean abstract art is classified into 4 major themes: 'spaces and properties of matter (물성)', 'repetition and structures', 'actions and pastimes' and 'color-field and light'. Selected are 80 unparalleled pieces produced by 44 excellent artists, which can be suitably categorized into the above-mentioned 4 themes, amongst Korean artists who left their amazing marks on the stage of the Korean abstract art for the past 50 years.   The section of 'spaces and properties of matter' is centered around artists steadily groping for the matters of the plane in paintings and the specificity of materials. They started from hot abstract art and gradually establish their own methods. Under the theme of 'repetition and structures' are artists who show the repetition of single colors and are aware of the plane as the structure, which is quite unique in the Korean abstract art.  The section of 'actions and pastimes' consists of Korean artists who are aspired by passionate abstract impressionism and have eyes to post-abstract impressionism. The section of 'color-field and light' is organized with works by color-field abstract artists and the artists who actively embody the concept of light. In this section artists usually quote light as divine revelation and/or focus on the pure incarnation of light.  This exhibition aims at classifying the changing processes of the Korean abstract art for the past 50 years into 4 themes, and at trying to communicating between the two generations living this era in the Korean society. In this exhibition you can enjoy the pure awareness of beauty by the generation who consider 'abstract art' is equal to 'modern art', and the young generation pursuing multiple and diverse concepts of 'art.' Sincerity and passion that generated from participating artists all the time will make contribution to the production of far more in-depth and abundance of the contemporary art.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_b6a6efb3d22e482ab50bded48dded0bf_970d2b7098da4345880dafbb63dbbf57,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=102,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Our museum collects works of art twice a year. Last year, we collected total 235 works of art, 88 during the first half and 147 during the second half. We have been collecting works of art since 1985 and with the collection from last year, we have total 2237 works of art now.    The works that are going to be displayed at this exhibition are collected thorough our online collection events and special exhibitions. Since, before holding a special exhibition, works of art for the exhibition are carefully selected after a thorough examination, the special exhibitions provided us good opportunities to collect high-quality works of art. Due to the limited space, we’ve had to select among the works of art in the collection.    After selecting works of art from the collection, we have grouped them by common characteristics. As a result, we have come to have seven sections and we have assigned each section a concept that can represent the works of art belonging to the section. We think each concept will help our citizens appreciate and understand the works of art more easily. In fact, the exhibition of the collection of the year has been more like an annual report of Museum’s activities of the year and therefore it hasn’t been paying enough attention to providing citizens an opportunity to appreciate works of art. Thus, at this exhibition, we provide our audience an ‘appreciation map’ consisting of the concepts assigned to the seven sections in order to help them enjoy the exhibition.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_380f493246c2402787119f45165f28ca_998b41b05e7d4e22ac8fd13c4b1e2aa1,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=100,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Art pieces will be displayed in a different private spaces on two floors according to its theme such as ceramics(white porcelain of Joseon Dynasty), old constructions(palace, royal ancestors' shrine, The Great South Gate, Korea-style house), paintings(paintings, folktale, mural paintings of ancient tombs from Joseon Dynasty), Buddhist statues, towers and old tombs.    The exhibition &lt;Treasure in My Heart&gt; shows appreciation(hommage) to rich heritage which was such an inspiration to many artists and the origin of their work. This means a lot to the artists as an everlasting theme of their work as well as a never-ending longing. We hope that this gives audience a good opportunity to find and cherish their own treasure through creative art pieces of contemporary artists who instilled the beauty and spirit of our cultural heritage into their works.     South Korea's national treasure, Sungnyemun, was burned down by an arsonist recently. In relation to this accident, people have begun to think over how such cultural properties have been neglected and to realize the importance and value of such heritage.

In the honor of May, 'the month of family,' this exhibition has been prepared so that families as well as office workers at adjacent companies can freely appreciate art works in an outdoor expended exhibition space, and even children can enjoy and participate in exhibition. Especially, in association with &quot;Hi-Seoul Festival,&quot; this exhibition provides an opportunity to reconsider the possibilities and variety of public art and performs the role and function as a public gallery.  ■ &lt;Gallery 'Spring' Outing&gt; Exhibition has attracted visitors with a unique theme every year, and this year, it comes with the title, &lt;Gulliver's Travel to the Gallery&gt;. Particularly, it is exhibited with works of Bourdelle, a worldly renowned sculptor, during the same term, which will be a good chance to investigate the negative meaning of sculptures or three dimensional works in various perspectives.  ■ This exhibition aims to provide visitors with the fun to appreciate works as if they look into the world of children, and travel as in &lt;Gulliver's Travels&gt;. We all would stretch imagination reading &lt;Gulliver's Travels - to the world of little men and the world of giants&gt; during our childhood. In fact, &lt;Gulliver's Travels&gt; of Jonathan Swift was a novel satirizing the dark history of politics of England in the 18'th century. In the little men's world(Lilliput), the politicians are divided into two parties: low heel party and high heel party. They get involved in party strife just because of the height of shoe heel. Further, they wage a war against the neighboring country because of their different view on whether to eat an egg from the top or below, which represents politicians' simplicity, foolishness, and ridiculous desire to rule.  ■ The lessons of fairy tales are not limited to children. This fairy tale makes us ponder over the meaning of truth, honor, justice, humility, tolerance, courage, and love through the keen satire of the injustice in the world of adults. That is why the fairy tale(Gulliver's Travels) is presented in association with this exhibition in hope that we can expand the scope of our thinking on objects.  ■ All visitors become Gulliver in this exhibition, just as Gulliver travels. Just as Gulliver talks about his experiences in the world of little men and the world of giants, artists satirize and represent the reality of this society with their imagination.

Despite his yearning for the classical beauty of pre-Renaissance, nostalgia for Greece's archaic art in particular, without limiting himself to its imitation Bourdelle created numerous masterpieces that expressed energy and dynamic force. His art has been placed a great deal of weight in the history of Western sculpture until today.  Emile-Antoine Bourdelle (1861 ~ 1929) was born in Montauban, a small town in the Southern France, in 1861. Bourdelle developed a novel and exclusive sculpture realm of his own after surveying the sculptures of ancient Greece, Rome and even ancient Egypt. Mainly focusing the portrait sculptures of male heroes, he left behind a great number of magnificent, dynamic, rough and powerful masculine sculptures. Bourdelle wished that, through the simplification of the shape based on the essential structure of objects, sculpture was positioned as independent architecture. By declaring that &quot;Sculpture is to create objects&quot; rather than giving a graphic representation of human beings or nature, he suggested the new possibility of sculpture -- sculpture itself is a meaningful form. Ultimately, newly establishing the relationship between sculpture and architecture above the form of order and the value of formation, Bourdelle could lay the groundwork for his complete monumental sculpture.                   The exhibition will be a great opportunity for the public to enjoy the touches of the master that was not as well-known as he has been elsewhere with 75 sculptures, 48 sketches and water-colored paintings.  Among all the works from Musee Bourdelle de Paris, the works Daniel Gervis recommended will take you to a journey to the artist's youth and to his very meridian, where the artist was greatly influenced by Symbolism and Expressionism, and the synthesis of the two ideologies.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_64a5979e81b347f0bdb160e4204cb80e_d558a104bf374756862be5e1ccd39289,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=95,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The exhibition &lt;Writing Paintings, Painting Words&gt; is intended to look into aspects of employment of words in contemporary art and contemplate on the ways they function and create meanings in works.  As observed in many ancient hieroglyphics, the words and images were once &quot;one&quot; thing originally. The two means of communication have the same characteristic ‘the bowls that convey what men want to say’ and they have kept the mutual relationship in which one of them covers the  part that the other one cannot possibly express in full.  In Asian art, words and illustrations have naturally coexisted and breathed together in works of many art forms such as poetry, writing, painting as well as the formative writing, calligraphy. In European art, the crossing and juxtaposition between words and images can be found easily in many various trends of art such as cubism, futurism, dadaism and surrealism. The words show up frequently in the contemporary art works that this exhibition consists, what would be the reason for that? Perhaps, it is because the formativeness and symbolism of words provide the artists with continuous ideas and inspirations and add more meanings to the works for better interpretation.   Through the three themes, &lt;Painting Words&gt;, &lt;Writing and Painting&gt; and &lt;Writing Paintings&gt;, this exhibition will go beyond the stereotypic ideas that words are used only in writings and images are used only in paintings and look into the crossing  between writing language and painting language. By appreciating the works of artists who have built the foundation of unique formative language between writing language and painting language, we will be able to rediscover the trends of the contemporary art and travel into joyful world of art through communication with visual and auditory languages the works bring on.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_1470d44823f24e3bb281fdeb99934db7_3187f9d5ecc04c44babc2dec4321f8cb,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=94,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

It is the first retrospective exhibition of Gogh ever to take place in Korea and it is the largest since the 100th anniversary exhibition of Gogh held at Amsterdam van Gogh Museum of Art in 1990.   ○ The exhibition is set up in a chronological order of his works so that people have easier approach to the works from their birth to progress. There will be a number of representative works from each period of his artistic career on display such as the first period in which he tried to accomplish the humanitarianism by putting the miserable lives of poor peasants on canvas in Netherland (1881-1885) and the next period in Paris when he discovered impressionists' works as inspiration for the foundation of his own unique style of painting (1886-1888), and the following period in Arles where he experimented with colors to embody his idealistic ideas (1888-1889), and the next period of Saint-R&eacute;my during which he poured out his uncontrolled artistic passion into natural depictions (1889-1890), and the last period in Auvers-sur-Oise which marked his last 70 days of life (1890).   ○ It was not until he died that his works became to be recognized by the world. Since then, his works have had a great influence on many artistic trends such as Impressionism, Fauvism, Abstractionism, and Expressionism and have been the model for many artists of the 20th century. &quot;Your hard work will not fade away in vain.. I am very confident that people will appreciate your works in future. The only question is when..&quot;, said his brother Theo.

Photography has apparently facing the upphase outstanding not only in art market but also in diverse biennale and major exhibitions. This exhibition will provide a chance to look at the landscape of Korean contemporary photography since 1960 through the works of 22 photographers who have been working actively.    Photography was first introduced in 1880 in Korea. However, It was difficult for Korean photographers to work professionally as Korea had to go through great hardship such as colonization and war until 1950s. In 1960s, Korean photograph faced new aspect through appearance of photographers who observe the society with their own point of view as well as getting out of 'Realism' and 'Amateurism'. Workof photographers who started working at this time is displayed in the first section, when photograph department was established setting up photograph theories in Korea.    Korean mainstream photographers' work is exhibited in the second section. When they began to work, status of photograph and working environment were improving thanks to economic growth. Liberalization of study abroad also triggered new trend of photograph. They lead innovative exhibitions which continued before and after 1990s showing new possibility with extraordinary work very different from before. They seemed not to be categorized in a particular genre revealing the possibility of new expression. Therefore, photograph took root as an important medium for general artists promoting itself to be exhibited in the galleries which were reluctant for photograph.       The final section is for new photographers who just started to present before and after the new century. For the last years, photograph magazine was launched,  theorists as well as critics appeared, exhibition has become vitalized and art market has been apparently booming up. Under this new wave, these new faces are very distinguished from Korean traditional photograph in the respect of themes, materials and expressions. They express their own critical view about various socio-cultural issues focusing on current life and society rather than Korean traditional beauty.              This exhibition is expected to help the audience understand about Korean contemporary photograph.

They identify current issues and create new styles by broaching contemporary culture ahead of the mainstream, and reflecting them in their works.    The &quot;SeMA 2004&quot; exhibition being launched this year is designed to showcase promising young artists active in the Korean art scene, and to place contemporary society and culture in perspective.    Various galleries and museums in Korea have already established similar programs that annually introduce the works of promising young artists, whose original works play an increasingly significant role in Korea's modern art world.  The Seoul Museum of Art's efforts to discover young artists began a little later than other galleries, yet it  has distinguished itself among the rest in that it does not merely introduce young artists and their works  but takes it a step further: looking at issues of contemporary art and culture that are reflected in the art.    The young participants of SeMA 2004 develop new artistic  trends through an exploration of contemporary socio-cultural phenomena, which are subsequently incorporated into their works through unique perspectives and approaches. SeMA 2004 does more than simply display new artists' work: It presents culture in a contemporary setting so that each artist can explore his/her inner world against the backdrop of rapidly changing contemporary culture. The artists then &quot;read&quot; their works of art in new and innovative ways.    The SeMA 2004 exhibition explores six themes in the contemporary cultural milieu of the young, addressing key concepts such as 'digital,' 'fast,' 'internet' and 'individualism,' which represent the culture of the current generation.     The first exhibit, &quot;Consumption game-Dinosaur's trick&quot; is a reflection of reality, which delves into the issue of hypes in capitalist desires, a dominant theme of today’s consumer society where 'fast' culture dominates.    In &quot;Replay-Transplantation,&quot; contemporary artists transform traditional materials that were once used to express the humble desires of common people. They force us to look squarely at reality by capturing changes in the &quot;codes&quot; allowing the viewer to read into the works of new interpretations.    &quot;Kidult (Kid + Adult) - Self-portrait of the 21st century&quot; deals with a socio-cultural syndrome that attempts to eradicate boundaries between children and adults in terms of intellect and sensibility.    &quot;Lookism” investigates yet another world we live in, more idealized than real amidst the rapid Internet and digital culture. It analyzes Lookism, which is fuelled by commercialization, greed and the culture of capitalist consumption.    아？？(A-HaeH-HaeH) - Reality's gap&quot; captures the third meaning of ordinary objects and images seen in everyday life, which are set in totally different contexts: This reconfiguration shows the anti-cultural characteristics reflected by &quot;the other side&quot; of objects, using sharp satire and ironic humor to criticize reality.    Finally, in &quot;Playing alone-island, dream, metamorphosis,&quot; the senses grope to discover reality and existence through dreamy images presented in cultural environments of the contemporary world and through new methods of Internet communication.     With these six themes, the artists employ subtle wit combined with scathing satire to portray various phenomena in current society, symptoms they, themselves, are experiencing as they read and reinterpret the art from their own perspectives. The works reflect contemporary culture and contemporary perspectives on such cultures, as interpreted by the young artists.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192839_1e044c69718046f79195852e2c453ba8_f541efbec88e4e7d8565084c420348dc,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=16,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

It is purposed to give a light on various attitudes of contemporary artists who have rediscovered the values through interaction, mutual cooperation, and connection based on different areas or cultural differences since the end of 20th century and expanded their areas by the artists’ privilege to intervene with ‘artistic imagination.’ Also, ‘Hybridity,’ created as a byproduct from the process of collision and connection of various cultures in contemporary age caused by mobility and development of digital network, is the background, and it focuses on the role of artists who form identity of city space and its neighborhood and transform. This is not the intervention of artists in certain areas or gesture for political changes, but it suggests values which have been formed and rediscovered in ordinary relationship. In addition, different values are connected and added through artistic intervention, and it creates outcomes and synergies out of expectation beyond the expected mathematical calculation.

These languages do not express strong desires revealed in the physical body but traces of our inside being, which is breathing from a deep place in our lives, living together with our physical body, which is nothing but flesh and bones.   Text in Bodyscape has four sub-themes: Trace, Memory, Gesture, and Meditation.  The exhibition reflects on how desire and hurt, aspiration, anxiety, criticism, nostalgia, hope, and the like are revealed from our inside being through our physical bodies, and how works of art communicate messages about the lives of people living in modern society.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_fb93972b9e9e4ff7ab8e6b338176f030_cb747e3df43241d99b7c5df3e1ca0bad,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=83,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Its attempt to break from the traditional pattern, which had been seen somewhat customary and routine, has been steadily continued over the last three years, shifting it to the genre-by-genre pattern in the field of art handicraft, paintings and sculpture.     &lt;2007 Seoul Contemporary Art Exhibition&gt;, which will be the 22nd event this year, was designed to focus on the area of ‘engraving’, which has been relatively neglected compared to other genres, granting the works the opportunity to be displayed in public, so as to meet the growing need as well as to encourage the domestic artists involved in engraving works, thereby eventually seeking the way of developing and introducing the world of engraving to the people.   In preparing the &lt;2007 Seoul Contemporary Art Exhibition - Engraving&gt;, 280 artists engaged in engravings were selected before finally choosing 47 works through the deliberation by the advisory committee members comprising the external experts. Given the exhibition’s purpose aimed at evaluating the value and the potential development of the engraving, which tends to be newly evaluated recently in the contemporary art, some of the well-known artists were intentionally excluded. Such an attempt is expected to bring us the hope for seeing a more innovative exhibition as well as the possibility of shifting to the exhibition that will meet the need and trend in the year 2007.    The exhibit will give the artists the opportunities of demonstrating the experimental works, which will be used as the steppingstone toward the another world, not to mention the extensive scope and skills of the engraving. Among the exhibits are variety of contemporary works meeting and corresponding to the tendency of today’s art. Artists’ passion and will toward the arts will apparently be demonstrated in the exhibition. From the fundamentals to the patterns dubbed reprinting or reproducing, the exhibition is expected to serve as the detonator in the circle that will be measuring the tendency of the contemporary engraving.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_4ed786b63b1140e98dc1431c2623b084_34f70bbe65e541cd909e6bc5a0a8f666,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=81,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

There are 4 participating artists, Myeong-Ro Yun, Gang-So Lee, Su-Hwan Oh, and Cheol-Ju Seok who although have their own distinct worlds, do not settle in them but ceaselessly devise new works. Although they use western materials such as canvas, oil paints, acrylic etc., they all have a commonness in that they open a very psychological world of thought using an oriental way of thinking and method of expression.          The &lt;Respiration&gt; series of Myeong-Ro Yun which contains the breath of nature & the breath of earth as the subject, the &lt;Life Diary (Shinmong Yudo Wondo)&gt; series of Cheol-Ju Seok which portrays the landscape settled in our hearts, &lt;From the Island&gt; by Gang-So Lee which contains the energy of nature, and &lt;Change&gt; by Su-Hwan Oh which seeks to show vitality within the calmness are all from the oriental ideology focusing on nature if seen in the wider sense. Nature in the orient is not a concept or resource that is contradictory to civilization, but indicates the highest order that exists as its own. Here, nothing can be the center, not even human beings, but is a system of harmony & unity within the series of creation, settlement, change, and extinction. With the point that nothing can coexist without relationships, nature demands a humble attitude from us living in the human-centered modern age. Based on this awakening in relation to nature, the short or long one time brush strokes breathe with the scene while the works of art go beyond the artist unfolding as a venue of thought and meditation breathing together with the audience.    - Category : 43 pieces of Paintings, Ceramics, Photographs etc.  - Participating Artists : Myeong-Ro Yun, Gang-So Lee, Su-Hwan Oh, Cheol-Ju Seok (4 artists)",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=b32.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=46,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Moreover, it is constantly made a subject and tool of fine art within the artistic flow.   Just like the variety of meanings in the word 'dream' which represents hope and utopia while at the same time symbolizing fantasy, imagination and unconscious, the concept of dream also shows itself in many aspects of a work of art.  Besides a reflection of the unconscious and an original character, it is easy to find works of art which give an irrational and unfamiliar impression just like dreams that are the transcending space that comes and goes between the real and the unreal.   The &lt;Walking in Dreams&gt; exhibit takes a look at works about dreams or interpreted with an impression of dreams from as far back as ancient art to as close to the present as surrealist artists, within a contemporary context.   The title of the exhibit &lt;Walking in Dreams&gt; not only takes notice of the image of dreams in art, but also reflects the meditative character of the act of walking.

As the last of a series of events celebrating the 120th anniversary of French-Korean diplomatic relations, this exhibit will feature for the first time in Korea 49 new pieces including some never seen before work.    * Robert Combas (1957~ ) boldly broke away from the excessively intellectual and global style, the so called empty canvas, shown by modernism painting of the 70s.  He belongs to the neo-expressionism of the 80s, which emphasized the inherent painting method of 'drawing'.  He is often called the French Andy Warhol.   * He had a variety of talents that spanned through not only painting but all areas of art including sculpture, applied arts, music, etc.  Based on this talent, he showed exceptional work.  Combas was the 'rebel' in the European art circles that hauled French art out of the depression to rank with the world trends of the 80s including German neo expressionism, Italian transavantguarde, American new image painting.    * Combas's unique 'drawing' style that takes familiar images that we can find in everyday life, along with historical events throughout not only in his country but around the world and the artist's past memories and experiences and brings them out to reality presenting them as a new narrative.  This will provide good comparison with the styles of drawing recently spreading in Korea like a fad.    * Particularly, this exhibit features for the first time in Asia, his latest focus on his ambitious extra-large scroll work from 6 to 10 meters in length and &lt;Venus&gt;, the large sculpture of up to 7 meters in height.

He is one of the greatest masters of twentieth century art and had huge influence in various fields such as music, film, literature, and also in the area of popular culture, regardless of the East and the West.  Departing from his early work influenced by Cubism and Futurism, and influenced by Giorgio de Chirico and Surrealism, Magritte formed his own unique style of painting. However, unlike Surrealists, whose techniques such as automatism yield to almost abstract images, Magritte realistically portrayed familiar objects but placed them in incongruent settings or juxtaposed them with contrasting elements. Through this technique, called depaysement, he focused on visual shock or creating a mysterious atmosphere.   In this exhibition, we display his representative work from his entire oeuvre: his 1920’s work that demonstrate Chirico’s and Surrealism’s influences; major works from the 1930’s that demonstrate his depaysement techniques; Impressionist and Vache period work that appeared in the 1940’s; and his work at the end of his life in the 1960’s. Magritte’s photos, his short films, and other documentations that show his life and art are included in the show as well.

The theme for Seoul International Media Art Biennale which will be held for the fourth time, is &quot;Dual Realities.&quot; Artistic Director, Wonil Rhee who is one of the most active curators representing the Asian art world and international curators, Lev Manovich(USA), Yuko Hasegawa(Japan), Iris Mayr(Austria) and Pi Li(China) are curating for this biennale.  	As the Internet and multimedia become part of our lives, the physical world and virtual reality have become closely interrelated in this new era with media environment. Today, the discussion on the real world and virtual world is not new and cyberiaculture does not attract much attention any more. Nevertheless, the reason for the choice of &quot;duel realities &quot;as a theme of this exhibition is that physical reality and virtual reality are becoming more interchangeable and inseparable. 	&quot;Dual Realities&quot; will approach New Physicality with an artistic language and diverse and creative ideas that will sublimate positive and negative sides and the division of cyberspace to integration and even healing.  	This exhibition will analyze a paradoxical situation where the real world influences virtual reality under the keyword of &quot;Dual Realities,&quot; and represent Augmented Reality where the public identity such as SMS, messenger, Internet community, mobile communication expands. This exhibition will pose you a serious question that how the dual realities have evolved from the days of Nam June Paik's Moon is the oldest TV set.

Like SeMA 2004: Six Stories, SeMA 2006 includes six sections under one primary theme of 'Strangers of the City: Jungle Sunshine, Asphalt Kid, An Anonym, Nausea, Deviation, and Narrative Speaking.    All the six sections presented on SeMA 2006 depict different aspects of the city.  However, rather than the superficial form of the city or rosy, optimistic future which seems bright and growth oriented, the other side of such the city is examined.  The 2006 exhibition shows a kind of humanistic drama attempting to resolve the various emotions we have in the city.  It focuses on the emotions that come to us because we live in the city, a place where we must stay because we have no other choice, a place we can never escape from.  The emotions of the young - feelingsof insecurity, loneliness, desire to be deviate to another world or reflection, the urban sensitivity children come to have as they inescapably mustlive in a city, and other emotions we have in a city like an ad copy, &quot;Enjoy it if you cannot escape,&quot; are explored.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_631a09159f1a4d339e547f6e6a05cceb_84e8df6516634a308a103c256ef74cb7,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=44,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

As democracy pursues freedom and equality, art cries out and practices freedom and equality in this age. When art was centered on painting, photographic art was expanding its power in the corner. As a result of its perseverance, photographic art has been shining out. Same phenomenon is happening in photographic art itself. Documentary photography, purposed for objective observation and recording as well as the first acknowledged work of art, is still popular. Also, various types of photographs are appeared, even it is not able to list them up, and have their own voice.    The Photo-Secessionist, represented by Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946), claimed that photography is also art, ranked next to painting in &lt;Camera Work&gt;, which was their formal magazine. The exhibition &lt;Camera Work&gt; introduces various aspects of photographs, which have risen to the equivalent level of painting and sculpture so that visitors can understand modern photographic art.     The exhibition is mainly composed of photographic art works, owned by Seoul Museum of Art and photographic works of 10 artists are added. It is documentary photographic art, which represents a record of reality from objective perspective in terms of matters. Nevertheless, innocent or pictures-like photos, photos of artists, photos of scenery which can be interpreted in a new way, reflecting mentality of artists, newly created photos by choice and reconstruction of artists despite that it is no more than a mere object for photography, photos full of extraordinary beauty out of a context are displayed in the exhibition. Artists are sort of producers and directors who change objects or make an objet for a scene. Like a part of play, 7 photos are loosely displayed to show us storyline.

Nevertheless, we dream of something more than that.  Probably, we have more desire and the land of dreams compared to the past generations, who were less benefited by civilization. In the modern society, which is complicated, much, and rapid, we find ourselves looking for something that we can rely on or transcendental whether it is religion or hobby.   The exhibition of ‘Meditative Forest’ is designed to give an opportunity to the modern people to find the desire for consensus with nature and life, one of desires that they have in their heart while living in highly industrialized and mechanized society.    Nature, which everything is originated including men, is known as having a healing power. Not the nature only emits the chemical sources that we need, but it also makes us feel that exhaustion and struggling that we have are nothing compared to life, circulation and spaciousness of nature. Unlimited receptiveness of nature, which makes us receive simplicity, emptiness and everything by provision of nature, purifies our heart. Because of this, we aspire and seek for nature unceasingly, and we are able to find natural elements in art and music, which reflect the inner world of artists or musicians.   This exhibition consists of works, which make us feel meditative and static, representing ‘calmness’ through unique expression of artists on natural beings or expressing superior sublime beauty and awe of nature. This exhibition is to view nature expressed by 11 artists in the form of paintings, sculptures, photographs and installation art. This is also purposed to let people experience a respite and a beauty of slowness which nature can provide through art, especially in hot weather, as people feel the healing of both physical body and heart with purification when they step into the forest.   Through this exhibition, it is expected that people find the meaning of nature and life as well as a respite and relaxation out of their complicated daily life, experiencing the healing character of art.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114191917_c60dfdd69e754f9081e741aaa4509701_8eb530e176be436dbeb76799ed6ad2b1,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=50,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Figurative sculpture will be displayed in the Seoul Art Exhibition 2006, following last year whose main was the painting. Seoul Museum of Art and advisory committee took great pains to decide whether the scope and concept of figurative sculpture can be established since the distinguishing of genre seems like meaningless as most of art works frequently cross the genre.  For this exhibition, the committee and Seoul Museum of Art established the scope and concept, approaching ‘figurative sculptures’ from traditional perspective, rather than viewing sculptures in extended ways. This is opposite with abstract, meaning reconstruction of the object, in other words, imaginary objects which we can think of their existence in reality are reconstructed or expressed in the way that we can recognize. ‘Figurative’ is opposite with abstract, which presents us an optical embodiment of our concepts, not recognized.   This exhibition will provide a good opportunity to see various phases of contemporary figurative sculptures of Korea as artists in different age brackets are participated. It is also interesting to see the difference by generations as well as changes of age, as spectrum of diverse works can be phased and seen. The artist in 60s and 30s has a generation gap.  Korean art, which has changed rapidly in terms of economics and culture, is experiencing this, and it is revealed in art.

Such paintings are increasingly winning the sympathy of the public these days for their intense concentration, strong power of description, and extreme sensitivity.   This exhibition includes works by artists of hyper-realistic paintings from the 70s who attempted to dip into and, at the same time, transcend the figurative paintings of academism and abstract paintings characterized mainly by monochrome, those of 'mass art' who used realistic paintings as a mirror reflecting political reality, and those of multi-art forms since the 90s who depicted deep insights of objects or expressed their personal feelings through refined composition.   Representation Reconsidered will start the discussion on the nature of form, focusing specifically on the much more intense meaning than reproduced images of traditional meaning.  The twenty-four presented artists are so obsessed with objects as to make viewers feel extreme shock, and It is through their works that the viewers, who are living in the 'era of excessive images' where false desires are daily things and superficial digital images are rampant due to commercial imagery and exaggerated false images of popular culture, will have a strong desire to see ‘reality’ as it is, or to understand it beyond its exterior in order to reach the essence of reality.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_892eb2061a724a1cbcbd81f5cc161b4b_1487cbf92b5d4451b01ba0c89d5ff589,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=37,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Leaving an impressive and tremendous 50,000 works over 80 years, he imprinted his name upon all the world. So we can say the Art of  the 20th century started with Picasso, and moreover, considering the flourishing activities of his works, it is not too much to say the 20th century is Picasso’s century. This exhibition is planned to introduce the works of genius artist Pablo Picasso through a retrospective exhibition for the first time in Korea.   Generally, we can classify Picasso’s works from1895 to 1973 in six periods. The blue period, the rose period, the cubism period, the classical period right after World warⅠ, the surrealism period when he painted “Guernica”, and the very creative period from World war ll to his latest. This exhibition shows the most important representative works from each period. “La Famille Soler”(1903) in the blue period, “Le Pigeon”(1912) in the cubism period, “Trois Femmes &agrave; la Fontaine ”(1921) in the classicism period, “La Doremeuse au Miroir”(1932), “La Danse”(1927) in the surrealism period, and “Femme qui pleure”(1937) in the Guernica period, &quot;Le D&eacute;jeuner sur l'Herbe “ in the last period is the most outstanding work of Picasso.  The Main theme of this exhibition is “People of Picasso”. With chronological description, various works from the early to the last period show Picasso’s chronological change and changes of style and process. The spectators are able to meet Picasso’s women, his family, self-portraits, figures from history or his imagination, and so on, in one place.   As we all might know, Picasso’s work had always been affected and developed through his many relationships with women. We can’t even know the exact number of women through Picasso’s whole life. But we can see their figures and characters definitely in Picasso’s works.  In this exhibition, there will be a separate room displaying Picasso’s women. From Picasso’s first woman, Fernande Olivier(1904-1912, in a relationship years with Picasso), to Eva Gouel(1912-1915) and his first wife Olga Kokhlova(1917-1918), Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Walter(1927-1937), Dora Maar(1936-1943) and Fran&ccedil;oise Gilot(1943-1953) to his second wife and the last woman Jacqueline Roque(1952-1973), all of Picasso’s women will be represented.

As an elder in Korean painting circles and a leading painter, Park No-soo has throughout his entire life paved the way to an independent and original Korean style of painting. This donation, made in accordance with Park’s aspiration that his works should be passed on the general public, includes many state-of-the-art works that show Park’s view of art. The special exhibition covers all Park’s works from 1960 to 2000. It presents both donated pieces and ones purchased by the museum.   His work is often called &quot;a magnificent piece of painting.&quot; The suggestive aftereffect in his works is made from his elastic stroke of the brush and various nuances in his painting expression. That is why his work is praised as &quot;the height of a compromise between the sternness of bukhwa (a trend of painting) and the sentient feeling of namhwa (a trend of painting)&quot; or &quot;a magnificent piece of painting with a concise and intuitive style of stroke. Especially important are broad-minded diagonal composition, ellipsis and arrangement of things in the paintings, and modernistic beauty of modeling through the use of lucid color. It is impressive because those unique elements of his painting lead audiences to speculate of a perspective beyond things by outgrowing Korea’s typical frame of composition. His painting, nevertheless, includes an emotional feeling of painting in the literary artist's style called &quot;the unity of poem and painting,&quot; which enables Park to make his own independent and original area.   During his early years, he developed an original area to show the abstractive expression of figures, the bold composition and unique surface painting. Since then, he has presented a surface painting with proud loneliness, free and easy strokes of the brush, and a unique style of painting using blue-hued coloring and swift lines of the brush. Today, he achieves his own artistic area and shares it with the public by creating a subjective, abstractive painting with clear and beautiful lines, transparent colors, and free composition.  In this exhibition, an animation will be shown to help people understand Park’s works.

Their works deal with various themes using a lot of media ranging from basic materials such as dyes and Chinese inks to applied materials including daily commodities, natural dyestuffs, and industrial materials. Nevertheless, those works displayed have a point in common in that they request consistency, hard work, and long time to make.   As all works require us to have persistent inscription on our mind about the meaning of the works, complete preparation, and a lot of time, so did the job to create those works. And they finally make up of a crystallized whole of this exhibition called Resonance-Beyond Repetition. A big picture made by those works, however, does display physical traces and attributes without showing itself off. Instead, as in clear water purifying itself through being leached by other materials, those works lead you to a venue of thought and meditation. Following the repetitive scenes of materials, you will feel that they fill the space around you and your heart with resonance beyond repetition.

Despite its short life, Fauvism played a great role in the color revolution in the 20th century and has remained a very significant art movement.  Lasting only between 1904 and 1908, this short-lived movement is considered a very critical art movement in art history because of its break with the artistic traditions of the past, and its important role in the development of the avant-garde in modern art.  This exhibition focuses on the contribution of the Fauves whose work radically pursed a new style against traditional art based on a naturalistic (realistic) manner. It is fascinating to see how modern artistic view has been changed and affected by the fauves. With an intense, unmodulated application of pure color and the bold strokes of a loaded brush, this colorholic fauves break the traditional conception of naturalistic expression, and bring a different artistic viewpoint of new emotional expression.   This exhibition invites you into a beautiful and luminous color adventure through the brilliant works of the leader of the Fauvism; Matisse, Derain, Dufy, Derain, Vlaminck, and Dongen, etc.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_100a22a0f914487aaad16ebcc748ae1e_382501510c4f4b00b2ef362c64a9a422,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=33,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

Traditional distinctions among different cultural and art genres have long become blurred. The definition of a genre has been extended continuously through countless cultural and ideological experiments. Just as the photography began to claim its own place in art in the early 20th century, there has been increasing attempts, starting mid 1990, to fuse fashion and art. However most of the exhibitions devoted to this aim have failed to go beyond superficial level, with their focus mainly on the visual similarities in the two genres.  In this context, “Visions of the Body 2005” which deals with the meaning of body in modern life is hope to further the discussion on how to find common grounds in art and fashion.  Fashion, modern art and body   “Visions of the Body 2005” explores the meaning of body, but the way the issues are presented encourage viewers to debate new possibilities of mixing fashion and art. The exhibition’s theme, the changing concepts of the body, is one of the most frequently discussed issues in fashion and art since 1990s, and is dealt with in the current show in a broader cultural and historical context. The basic structure of the exhibitions resembles the 1999 “Visions of the Body: Fashion or Invisible Corset” hosted by the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto, which was acclaimed for its excellent interpretation on the relationship between 20th century fashion and the concepts of the body. The show was also noted for the way it contrasted experimental works of fashion designers and artists, and for the projection it made on the future of the relationship between the two genres. Now we are living in the 21st century, and it is very likely that the subject, the relationship between body and fashion, will be further explored. “Visions of the Body 2005,” is designed to encourage a more in-depth debate on the issue.

In addition, the exhibition also features dress, ornaments, furniture, metal craftworks to help viewers understand the background of and characters in portraits.  Exceptional advancement in portrait painting in Korea, China and Japan is attributable for its respect for ancetors and Confucius tradition of loyalty and filial piety. While portraits in the Western painting were developed for recording and appreciation purposes, portraits in these three countries were used for ancestor worshipping ceremonies. As such, subjects of portraits were also subject of worshipping such as saints, loyal servants and faithful wives, and the paintings not only captured realistic features of subjects, but expressed characters, disposition, dignity and other nature of the subject. As a result, portrait art of these three countries has reached a unique stage where distinctiveness and idealism of each of these three countries are in exquisite harmony with individual character of each subject. Despite common purpose and objective, portrait art of each of these three countries come to have distinctive features from different cultural background.  The exhibition provides a rare opportunity to have a glimpse of artistic and historic value of East Asian portrait pieces and also serves educational purpose to let viewers understand unique Oriental Confucius theory.

9,37,Life Landscape展,,"Seoul Museum of Art Main Building, 1F",2004-08-19,2004-09-17,,,,,,,,,,"This exhibition aims to throw light on figurative paintings previously overshadowed by visual-media, concept and installation.  While Korean abstract paintings have established itself as a distinct art-form like monochrome or minimalism through continuous exhibitions here and abroad, relatively slight approach to figurative paintings have ever been attempted: not only are they conservative of broaching varied angles after post-70’s hyperrealism and 80’s critical realism, they mostly remain in simple schema of landscape, still-life, and character.  The aims of this exhibition, therefore, are to explore the possibilities of figurative art, largely neglected from Korean art after the 90’s, and attempt a more colorful approach to figurative art.Under the overall title of ‘Life Landscape,’ the exhibition consists of two smaller themes: ‘Landscape with a Fat Sofa’ and ‘Beyond Landscape.’  The first theme, ‘Landscape with a Fat Sofa’ externalizes the ‘Life Landscape’ and its traces of routine human life, as symbolized by ‘Fat Sofa’ adopted from Hwang Ji-Woo’s poem of same title &#8211; paradoxically - exposing the inherent tragedy of modern life through a naked compression of the mundane.  If the first theme externalized the traces of the mundane, the second, ‘Beyond Landscape’ expands into the fundamental human dilemma such as ennui or solitude co-existing under such ‘everyday’ landscapes and blends these psychological footprints into the landscape of life.  Then why Hwang Ji-Woo? Post-90’s figurative arts in Korea, even among its various modes, are known for their ‘everyday narrative’ of ‘our everyday life landscape and story’; Hwang Ji-Woo is highly acclaimed for his superb poetry suggesting this very private flow of ‘everyday.’    Plays or journals from where the ‘A Diary of a Fat Sofa’ motif was derived, or the use of such characters like ‘Mr. Sofa’ in Other fiction, for example, all attest to its surpassing a simply personal work to gain a symbolic social meaning called ‘the burial under ennui phenomenon,’ the metaphor with which to blend the subject ‘Life Landscape’ of this particular exhibition.  ㅇ Exhibited Works: 40 Figurative Paintings ㅇ Participating Artists:  Hwang Young-Ja, Yi Heung-Dok, Lee Young-Ok, Lim Man-Hyuk, Son Jin-A, Park Young-Kyun, Hong Se-Yeon, Kwon Hee-Jong, Lee Joon-Gu, Ryu Young-Joon, Kim Dong-Ki, Cho He-Seung, Kong Song-Hoon, Nam Ki-Ho, Lim Byung-Kuk, Son Young-Gyu",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=104_04151.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=9,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

This exhibition provides a rare and special opportunity for visitors to view a wide array of Chagall's works spanning his long career from 1915 to the 1980s.  Recognized as one of the most creative and imaginative artists of the 20th century, Marc Chagall was inspired by the fauvists' vivid colors and the cubists' new concept of space. Drawing from these influences, he addressed Russian folklores and traditional Jewish themes, employing colorful and often whimsical folkloric imagery to create his highly imaginative and very personal style. Chagall has often been admired as a forefather of surrealism due to the surrealistic inventiveness and fantasy of his works. However, he was never linked to a particular movement but maintained his own style, creating some of the most unique and fantastic imagery.  The exhibition is composed of seven parts that would help to understand his art world; The 1st section: Couple * Lovers, the 2nd section: Imagination, the 3rd section: Paris, the 4th section: Circus, the 5th section: Bible, the 6th section: Odyssey by Homer, the 7th section: Mediterranean World.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_cfa2d5a9d15b41358ddf27c853dc81f0_3369ca2eee82457ea75839622ffdc07b,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=78,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
57,35,Space(空 [void] +間 [gap]),,"SeMA Main Building, 1st Floor",2004-07-06,2004-08-08,,,,,,,,,,"&quot;Space&quot; has not been recognized as important element in the composition of an object, as it is considered merely the background that surrounds an object. However, in contemporary art, drawings that were once two-dimensional began to occupy a three-dimensional space, and space has come to be recognized as a significant element in a work. Furthermore, an increasing number of works are considered complete only when presented against the background of the surrounding element of space, rather than by themselves.  In these works, a line, which is the most fundamental element of drawing, is drawn in space to form an object. And as conventional  two-dimensional drawing is brought into a space, the works present a new concept of space that is non-material and the composition of these lines  highlights their relationship with space all the more. .  空 (Void) refers to a state that exists in itself, lacking substance, whereas 間 (gap)  refers to a space between one place and another. Thus, 空間 (space) refers to an empty place that no object occupies or an abstract concept implying this meaning. Space has emerged as a significant element that completes a work in contemporary art.  Here, space is an essential intangible element that forms the composition of a work by maintaining an organic relationship with substance and materials by communicating with them. The focus is now placed on elements that surround a sculpture or installation work that is presented in a three-dimensional space, maintaining a close relationship with the space.  The exhibition &lt;Space (空+間)&gt; seeks to explore and reinterpret the meaning of space in contemporary art. It examines the significance of space formed by the gap between lines in a work presented in a three-dimensional world, and recognizes the importance of space in works of art.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_9a9828d5b9004f6298e0f333ef3d51a4_58aa0af61554493483c0751b54c8a2ee,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=57,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
58,34,Document,,"SeMA Main Building, Floors 1,2,3",2004-05-25,2004-06-27,,,,,,,,,,"Since photography began to be recognized as one of the most crucial  media in contemporary art in the late 1990s, &quot;art&quot; photographs have flooded the contemporary art landscape, producing various methodologies and discourses. Against this backdrop, the &quot;Document&quot; exhibition reflects the very starting point of photography, i.e. the photograph as a &quot;document&quot; and objective observation, rather than as an art form.  It was in the early 1990s that photography found its place in art museums and galleries. Since then, many young artists have been experimenting with a wide array of photographic techniques to explore a broad spectrum of topics, and their efforts have played an important role in expanding the concepts and methods of photography.  Recently, various art magazines and galleries have run feature articles and curated special exhibitions to diagnose these trends in photography and introduce various discourses.   Meanwhile, however, the origin of photography as objective observation and documentation of reality is often overshadowed by such romantic projections of photography as art. In this regard, this exhibition is designed to revisit the photograph as a document, which has been relatively undervalued in Korean photography - how photography reproduces and structures objects and facts, reality and history, and how this praxis of photography is systematized into &quot;knowledge.&quot;   To that end, the exhibition is divided into three themes: &quot;Mr. Gubo goes to an exhibition,&quot; &quot;From photography as document to photography as art,&quot; and &quot;Attitudes of documentation.&quot;",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20040525.jpg,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=58,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

As such, the exhibition transforms a museum, generally considered an institution too aloof  and authoritative to be accessed by the general public, into a familiar space where mundane activities such as family outings can take place through the visual arts.    When one thinks of a museum, the first image is usually white-walled cubicles or magnificent architecture. This exhibition is designed to change such an attitude through a new exhibit concept: More familiar and public means are used to “go out to find viewers.&quot;     Works of art are no longer inside, but in the outdoor spaces of the museum, the borders where the museum’s interior and exterior meet. Outside the bounds of the “institution,” it is where art and daily life come together.  The exhibition consists of three parts.   Part I is exhibited along the entrance roads to Seoul Museum of Art,  the courtyard and the facade of the museum building. Eight artists are participating in Part I, including Lee Soon-joo,  Bae Young-hwan, Kim Shi-ha, Seo Jeong-guk + Kim Mi-in, Kim Ju-ho, Kim Tae-joon, Lee Ki-seop, and Kim Min-a.  They have installed their works, along the entrance roads and courtyard of the museum to change people's awareness through the art medium: public constructions as traffic signs(Lee Soon-joo), stone posts (Bae Young-hwan) and guardrails (Kim Shi-ha). Other seek interactive engagement with viewers through works that combine aesthetics and function such as the art bench(Seo Jeong-guk + Kim Mi-in and Kim Ju-ho).  In addition, use of promotional devices such as banners(Lee Ki-seop) and ad-balloons(Kim Jae-joon) also give a new look to the museum, breaking away from the conventional image of a museum as a rigid organization.    Part II is an innovative outdoor exhibit created by seven participants, including Kim Hyuck, Song Pil, Lee Ki-il, Jeong In-yeop, Kang Sun-mi, Cha Min-young, Lee Jae-kwang + Son Min-young + Choe Jeong-wan. They employ the 'Zorb,' a gigantic transparent urethane ball also known as a super ball, which has generally been used only indoors. Their work is aimed at changing the concept of outdoor art, until now, mostly monumental sculpture, to shatter the border that defines the inside and outside of a museum while presenting art that is more accessible and people-friendly.    Part III, &quot;I am also an artist&quot; program, is installed in the museum garden and small garden at the City Hall Annex.  In this hands-on exhibit, citizens can take an active part: as producers, not merely passive consumers of art.  The exhibit nullifies the stereotypical concept that an exhibit must be inside an institution: It not only presents art in spaces more accessible to viewers, but also takes a new approach on how to 'show' or 'view' works of art.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192837_3883d339490c417f819e22c9ababd2e8_00eecc538fb946a6a3e1d353ad646a8f,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=59,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The exhibition, “Pierre & Gilles: Beautiful Dragon,” is particularly significant in that it is not only the first exhibition introducing Pierre & Gilles to the Korean public but is also a large-scale retrospective exhibition of their works from the late 1970s to the most recent works up to 2003.     The works of this French collaborative duo are highly recognized for the utopian fantasy expressed through creative glamour photographs of celebrities such as Jean Paul Gautier, Madonna, Catherine Deneuve, among others, which are then lavishly painted over with a uniquely homosexual sensibility  in the classic Baroque  style.    With the help of the French government, Seoul Museum of Art has been able to borrow a few of the original works from private collectors in France. Thus, this exhibit of 68 original works will give viewers a very precious opportunity to appreciate Pierre & Gilles’ art, which has not been seen by the general public.

The Museum already held many works of realism and expressionism including those from the '80s, and it added works by Kim Geong-in and Min Jeong-gi (in 2002), thereby creating a collection that in its entirety allows visitors to grasp the major trends in art history in Korea.  In addition, the Museum augmented what was previously a scant collection of abstract art pieces.  Most of the abstract artworks collected are by artists who participated in the opening exhibition of the Seoul Museum of Art, 'Light and Color of the Korean People,' held in 2002.  In selecting pieces for the collection of abstract art, the Museum intends to represent and draw attention to each major trend in contemporary Korean art and to strike a balance between them.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114192838_d3f31bc5aec349f9a54e1d1e5b301e34_98cc7276e58a4de0aa8d988aadc695e3,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=65,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738

The each expression and the spirit shown in the artworks are from the diversity of the formative arts which came from the times they lived in. But it is the sublime art spirit that turns the variety into sympathy.       The exhibition displays various genres of artworks and divide them not simply  chronologically but by figurative and abstractive order. It presents the changes in the traditional world of art and works by theme and trend. Works of Gi-chang Kim, Namkwan, Eungno Lee, Gyungchae Ryu are worth noticing in the exhibition. These works present dramatic changes in order from figurative to abstractive and also let us to track how figurative style and idea of an individual artist get changed by aesthetic consciousness of the times. A work represents self-examination of an individual artist in a time and reflects the spirit of his time.  We expect you to find the meaning of the exhibition in the aspect that the value of art is not only applied in an artist's times but contains some spiritual meaning that has to be descended to posterity.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114191917_545bac278d31436bb82b78a7a651c48b_940f6cc556b149d2901442bbb84266e4,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=7,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
8,18,Life : Realism art in 1980's,,SEOUL MUSEUM OF ART,2003-02-11,2003-06-29,,,,,,,,,,"The show is arranged to study variously embodied phenomenon of understanding realty and speech of the artists who participated in social and historic situation of that time.  In 1980's participative national art appeared as a movement of self awakening of the time extensively denying modernism which was the main stream of existing artist's world. It would be said that the movement suggested new trend in both conceptional and formal aspects trying to overcome modernism which adhered to elitism captured by the idea of art for art's shake alienating itself from real life. (Seoul Museum of Art names the style like that 'Realism in 80's) The main idea of the realism art in 80's is to recover mutual understanding with the public throughout perceiving reality and returning figure, so it was confirmation of life above just personal expression and moreover medium to realize a field of mutual understanding for better life.  Realism art in 80's also showed a phase of cultural movement which widely communicated with the contemporaries in relation with situation of the time. Therefore, from the viewpoint of Korean modern art history, realism art in 80's has significance on the fact that it is spontaneous art form reflecting our specific historicity. The art works displayed art expression of reality of life. From the works dealt with social historical context to individual life, you would see various expression of artists' suffering and understanding of reality. In this point of view, this exhibition would be good opportunity for audiences to meditate on true meaning of life.",http://sema.seoul.go.kr/common/imageView?FILE_PATH=%2Fdata%2Fdisplay%2F&FILE_NM=20190114191917_4ba6ec1d4d40451e8d22ea83ec88b031_3512d6636bb4414b9476438fdd22c304,https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/whatson/exhibition/detail?exNo=8,2025-04-17,37.56424,126.9738
